# About

The documentation for the R package `stana`. `stana` is developed for the analysis of intra-species diversity in R environment.

## Motivation 

Computational pipelines have been developed to illuminate intra-species diversity, derived from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene contents of species. However, there have been limited software for performing integrated analyses, resulting in an unprepared environment. We have developed an R package named stana, to integrate and analyse data generated from such metagenomic sequences. The package allows for necessary preprocessing, functional analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization of the results.
