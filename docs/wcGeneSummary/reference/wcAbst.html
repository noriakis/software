Their recognition by the sensors of the innate immune system represents the front line of host defence. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity responses is an important prerequisite for the design of effective antivirotics. This review focuses on the present state of knowledge surrounding the mechanisms of viral DNA genome sensing and the main induced pathways of innate immunity responses. The studies that have been performed to date indicate that herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and polyomaviruses are sensed by various DNA sensors. In non-immune cells, STING pathways have been shown to be activated by cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, or DNA-PK. The activation of TLR9 has mainly been described in pDCs and in other immune cells. Importantly, studies on herpesviruses have unveiled novel participants (BRCA1, H2B, or DNA-PK) in the IFI16 sensing pathway. Polyomavirus studies have revealed that, in addition to viral DNA, micronuclei are released into the cytosol due to genotoxic stress. Papillomaviruses, HBV, and HIV have been shown to evade DNA sensing by sophisticated intracellular trafficking, unique cell tropism, and viral or cellular protein actions that prevent or block DNA sensing. Further research is required to fully understand the interplay between viruses and DNA sensors.</span>

Recent reports suggest that DDX41MutGL myeloid malignancies could be considered as a distinct entity, even if their specific presentation and outcome remain to be defined. We described here the clinical and biological features of 191 patients with DDX41MutGL AML. Baseline characteristics and outcome of 86 of them, treated with intensive chemotherapy in 5 prospective ALFA/FILO trials were compared with those of 1604 DDX41 wild-type (DDX41WT) AML patients, representing a prevalence of 5%. DDX41MutGL AML patients were mostly males (75%) in their seventh decade, with low leukocyte count (median, 2x109/L), low bone marrow blast infiltration (median, 33%), normal cytogenetics (75%) and few additional somatic mutations (median, 2). A second somatic DDX41 mutation (DDX41MutSom) was found in 82% of patients and clonal architecture inference suggested that it could be the main driver for AML progression. DDX41MutGL patients displayed higher complete remission (CR) rates (94% vs. 69%, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and longer restricted mean overall survival (OS) censored at hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) than ELN-2017 intermediate/adverse (Int/Adv) DDX41WT patients (5-year ΔRMST of 13.6 months, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Relapse rates censored at HSCT were lower at 1 year in DDX41MutGL patients (15% vs. 44%) but later increased to join that of Int/Adv DDX41WT patients at 3 years (82% vs 75%). HSCT in first CR was associated with prolonged relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.43 [95%CI, 0.21-0.88]; p = 0.02) but not with longer OS (HR=0.77 [95%CI, 0.35-1.68], p=0.5).</span>

With the availability of genetic testing, it is now clear that syndromic features may be lacking in patients with germline predisposition. Many genetic lesions underlying germline predisposition may also be mutated somatically in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; MDS and leukemias, making it critical to distinguish their germline origin. The verification of a suspected germline predisposition informs therapeutic considerations, guides monitoring pre- and post-treatment, and allows for family counseling. Presentation of MDS due to germline predisposition is not limited to children and spans a wide age range. In fact, the risk of MDS may increase with age in many germline predisposition conditions and can present in adults who lack classical stigmata in their childhood. Furthermore, germline predisposition associated with &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutations presents with older adult-onset MDS. Although a higher proportion of pediatric patients with MDS will have a germline predisposition, the greater number of MDS diagnoses in adult patients may result in a larger overall number of those with an underlying germline predisposition. In this review, we present a framework for the evaluation of germline predisposition to MDS across all ages. We discuss characteristics of personal and family history, clinical exam and laboratory findings, and integration of genetic sequencing results to assist in the diagnostic evaluation. We address the implications of a diagnosis of germline predisposition for the individual, for their care after MDS therapy, and for family members. Studies on MDS with germline predisposition have provided unique insights into the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies and mechanisms of somatic genetic rescue &lt;i&gt;vs.&lt;/i&gt; disease progression. Increasing recognition in adult patients will inform medical management and may provide potential opportunities for the prevention or interception of malignancy.</span>

However, activation of the STING pathway by airway silica or smoke exposure leads to cell death, self-dsDNA release, and STING/type I IFN dependent acute lung inflammation/ARDS. The inflammatory response induced by a synthetic non-nucleotide-based diABZI STING agonist, in comparison to the natural cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, is unknown. A low dose of diABZI (1 µg by endotracheal route for 3 consecutive days) triggered an acute neutrophilic inflammation, disruption of the respiratory barrier, DNA release with NET formation, PANoptosis cell death, and inflammatory cytokines with type I IFN dependent acute lung inflammation. Downstream upregulation of DNA sensors including cGAS, DDX41, IFI204, as well as NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, suggested a secondary inflammatory response to dsDNA as a danger signal. DNase I treatment, inhibition of NET formation together with an investigation in gene-deficient mice highlighted extracellular DNA and TLR9, but not cGAS, as central to diABZI-induced neutrophilic response. Therefore, activation of acute cell death with DNA release may lead to ARDS which may be modeled by diABZI. These results show that airway targeting by STING activator as a therapeutic strategy for infection may enhance lung inflammation with severe ARDS. STING agonist diABZI induces neutrophilic lung inflammation and PANoptosis A, Airway STING priming induce a neutrophilic lung inflammation with epithelial barrier damage, double-stranded DNA release in the bronchoalvelolar space, cell death, NETosis and type I interferon release. B, 1. The diamidobenzimidazole (diABZI), a STING agonist is internalized into the cytoplasm through unknown receptor and induce the activation and dimerization of STING followed by TBK1/IRF3 phosporylation leading to type I IFN response. STING activation also leads to NF-kB activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6. 2. The activation of TNFR1 and IFNAR1 signaling pathway results in ZBP1 and RIPK3/ASC/CASP8 activation leading to MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis induction. 3. This can also leads to Caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis induction. 4. Self-dsDNA or mtDNA sensing by NLRP3 or AIM2 induces inflammsome formation leading to Gasdermin D cleavage enabling Gasdermin D pore formation and the release mature IL-1β and pyroptosis. NLRP3 inflammasome formation can be enhanced by the ZBP1/RIPK3/CASP8 complex. 5. A second signal of STING activation with diABZI induces cell death and the release of self-DNA which is sensed by cGAS and form 2'3'-cGAMP leading to STING hyper activation, the amplification of TBK1/IRF3 and NF-kB pathway and the subsequent production of IFN-I and inflammatory TNFα and IL-6. This also leads to IFI204 and DDX41 upregulation thus, amplifying the inflammatory loop. The upregulation of apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis is indicative of STING-dependent PANoptosis.</span>

Using a knockout mouse, we demonstrate that DDX41 is required for mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) survival and differentiation, particularly of myeloid lineage cells. Transplantation of Ddx41 knockout fetal liver and adult bone marrow (BM) cells was unable to rescue mice from lethal irradiation, and knockout stem cells were also defective in colony formation assays. RNA-seq analysis of Lin&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/cKit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Sca1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ddx41 knockout cells from fetal liver demonstrated that the expression of many genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were altered. Furthermore, differential splicing of genes involved in key biological processes was observed. Our data reveal a critical role for DDX41 in HSPC differentiation and myeloid progenitor development, likely through regulating gene expression programs and splicing.</span>

Development of MDS/AML is relatively common in germline DDX41 mutations. However, a variety of hematological malignancies (HMs) have been reported. We report a novel case of bi-alleleic DDX41 mutations in B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), with unusual location of DDX41 mutations. The gene expression profile (GEP) of Ph + B-ALL with bi-alleleic DDX41 mutations showed heterogeneously transitional GEP and altered gene expression levels of genes involved in the process essential for red blood cells and myeloid cell differentiation were noted. We report that DDX41 mutations are unusual but can be an underlying event in Ph + B-ALL and screening DDX41 mutations can be also informative for patients awaiting for haploidentical stem cell transplantation and choosing the therapy.</span>

Here, we investigate the responsiveness of pSS monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to STING activation in relation to systemic IFN-I pathway activation and compare this to SLE. Expression of DNA-sensing receptors cGAS, IFI16, ZBP-1 and DDX41, signalling molecules STING, TBK1 and IRF3, positive and negative STING regulators, and IFN-I-stimulated genes MxA, IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT1, and IFIT3 was analysed in whole blood, CD14+ monocytes, pDCs, and salivary glands by RT-PCR, monocyte RNA-sequencing data, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pSS, SLE and healthy controls (HC) were stimulated with STING-agonist 2'3'-cGAMP. STING phopshorylation (pSTING) and intracellular IFNα were evaluated using flow cytometry. STING activation induced a significantly higher proportion of IFNα-producing monocytes-but not pDCs-in both IFN-low and IFN-high pSS compared with HC PBMCs. Additionally, a trend towards more pSTING+ monocytes was observed in pSS and SLE, most pronounced in IFN-high patients. Positive STING regulators TRIM38, TRIM56, USP18 and SENP7 were significantly higher expressed in pSS than HC monocytes, while the dual-function STING regulator RNF26 was downregulated in pSS monocytes. STING was expressed in mononuclear infiltrates and ductal epithelium in pSS salivary glands. STING stimulation induced pSTING and IFNα in pSS and SLE pDCs. pSS monocytes and pDCs are hyperresponsive to stimulation of the STING pathway, which was not restricted to patients with IFN-I pathway activation.</span>

In addition to these RNA-related activities, in recent years a certain number of these helicases are reported to play important roles in anti-viral immunity through various ways. Along with RLHs, endosomal TLRs, and cytosolic DNA receptors, many RNA helicases including DDX3, DHX9, DDX6, DDX41, DHX33, DDX60, DHX36 and DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex act as viral nucleic acid sensors or co-sensors. These helicases mostly follow RLHs-MAVS and STING mediated signaling cascades to trigger induction of type-I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many of them also function as downstream adaptor molecules (DDX3), segments of stress and processing bodies (DDX3 and DDX6) or negative regulators (DDX19, DDX24, DDX25, DDX39A and DDX46). On the contrary, many studies indicated that several DEAD/H-box helicases such as DDX1, DDX3, DDX6, DDX24, and DHX9 could be exploited by viruses to evade innate immune responses, suggesting that these helicases seem to have a dual function as anti-viral innate immune mediators and viral replication cofactors. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge on several representative DEAD/H-box helicases, with an emphasis on their functions in innate immunity responses, involved in their anti-viral and pro-viral roles.</span>

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by an RNA-DNA hybrid with a displaced non-template DNA strand. We developed RNA-DNA Proximity Proteomics to map the R-loop proximal proteome of human cells using quantitative mass spectrometry. We implicate different cellular proteins in R-loop regulation and identify a role of the tumor suppressor DDX41 in opposing R-loop and double strand DNA break accumulation in promoters. DDX41 is enriched in promoter regions in vivo, and can unwind RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro. R-loop accumulation upon loss of DDX41 is accompanied with replication stress, an increase in the formation of double strand DNA breaks and transcriptome changes associated with the inflammatory response. Germline loss-of-function mutations in DDX41 lead to predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia in adulthood. We propose that R-loop accumulation and genomic instability-associated inflammatory response may contribute to the development of familial AML with mutated DDX41.</span>

However, whether ERVs extensively exist in ancient vertebrates remains unexplored. Here, we performed a genome-wide characterization of ERVs in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Approximately 3,315 ERV-like elements (&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs) were identified as Gypsy, Copia, Bel, and class I-III groups. &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs accounted for approximately 2.3% of zebrafish genome and were distributed in all 25 chromosomes, with a remarkable bias on chromosome 4. Gypsy and class I are the two most abundant groups with earlier insertion times. The vast majority of the &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs have varied structural defects. A total of 509 &lt;i&gt;gag&lt;/i&gt; and 71 &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; genes with coding potentials were detected. The &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;-coding elements were well-characterized and classified into four subgroups. A ERV-E4.8.43-DanRer element shows high similarity with HERV9NC-int in humans and analogous sequences were detected in species spanning from fish to mammals. RNA-seq data showed that hundreds of &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs were expressed in embryos and tissues under physiological conditions, and most of them exhibited stage and tissue specificity. Additionally, 421 &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs showed strong responsiveness to virus infection. A unique group of &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs with immune-relevant genes, such as &lt;i&gt;fga&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ddx41, ftr35, igl1c3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tbk1&lt;/i&gt;, instead of intrinsic viral genes were identified. These &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;ERVs are regulated by transcriptional factors binding at the long terminal repeats. This study provided a survey of the composition, phylogeny, and potential functions of ERVs in a fish model, which benefits the understanding of the evolutionary history of ERVs from fish to mammals. &lt;b&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/b&gt; Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are relics of past infection that constitute up to 8% of the human genome. Understanding the genetic evolution of the ERV family and the interplay of ERVs and encoded RNAs and proteins with host function has become a new frontier in biology. Fish, as the most primitive vertebrate host for retroviruses, is an indispensable integral part for such investigations. In the present study, we report the genome-wide characterization of ERVs in zebrafish, an attractive model organism of ancient vertebrates from multiple perspectives, including composition, genomic organization, chromosome distribution, classification, phylogeny, insertion time, characterization of &lt;i&gt;gag&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt; genes, and expression profiles in embryos and tissues. The result helps uncover the evolutionarily conserved and fish-specific ERVs, as well as the immune-relevant ERVs in response to virus infection.

Identifying innate IRGs associated with prognosis may improve treatment and reveal new immunotherapeutic targets. Gene expression profiles and clinical data of early-stage LUSC patients were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases and IRGs from the InnateDB database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analyses were performed to identify an innate IRG signature model prognostic in patients with early-stage LUSC. The predictive ability of this model was assessed by time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, with the independence of the model-determined risk score assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Overall survival (OS) in early-stage LUSC patients was assessed using a nomogram and decision curve analysis (DCA). Functional and biological pathways were determined by gene set enrichment analysis, and differences in biological functions and immune microenvironments between the high- and low-risk groups were assessed by ESTIMATE and the CIBERSORT algorithm. A signature involving six IRGs (SREBF2, GP2, BMX, NR1H4, DDX41, and GOPC) was prognostic of OS. Samples were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on median risk scores. OS was significantly shorter in the high-risk than in the low-risk group in the training (P &amp;lt; 0.001), GEO validation (P = 0.00021) and TCGA validation (P = 0.034) cohorts. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that risk score was an independent risk factor for OS, with the combination of risk score and T stage being optimally predictive of clinical benefit. GSEA, ESTIMATE, and the CIBERSORT algorithm showed that immune cell infiltration was higher and immune-related pathways were more strongly expressed in the low-risk group. A signature that includes these six innate IRGs may predict prognosis in patients with early-stage LUSC.</span>

Exclusion of candidate donors with CH is controversial since its impact on recipient outcomes and graft alloimmune function is uncertain. We performed targeted error-corrected sequencing on samples from 1,727 donors age 40 years or older and assessed the effect of donor CH on recipient clinical outcomes. We measured long-term engraftment of 102 donor clones and cytokine levels in 256 recipients at 3 and 12 months after transplant. CH was present in 22.5% of donors, with &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/i&gt; (14.6%) and &lt;i&gt;TET2&lt;/i&gt; (5.2%) mutations being most common; 85% of donor clones showed long-term engraftment in recipients after transplantation, including clones with a variant allele fraction &amp;lt; 0.01. &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A-&lt;/i&gt;CH with a variant allele fraction ≥ 0.01, but not smaller clones, was associated with improved recipient overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .042) and progression-free survival (HR, 0.72; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .003) after adjustment for significant clinical variables. In patients who received calcineurin-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, donor &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A-&lt;/i&gt;CH was associated with reduced relapse (subdistribution HR, 0.59; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .014), increased chronic graft-versus-host disease (subdistribution HR, 1.36; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .042), and higher interleukin-12p70 levels in recipients. No recipient of sole &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;TET2&lt;/i&gt;-CH developed donor cell leukemia (DCL). In seven of eight cases, DCL evolved from donor CH with rare &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; or splicing factor mutations or from donors carrying germline &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Donor CH is closely associated with clinical outcomes in transplant recipients, with differential impact on graft alloimmune function and potential for leukemic transformation related to mutated gene and somatic clonal abundance. Donor &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/i&gt;-CH is associated with improved recipient survival because of reduced relapse risk and with an augmented network of inflammatory cytokines in recipients. Risk of DCL in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is driven by somatic myelodysplastic syndrome-associated mutations or germline predisposition in donors.</span>

Recently, the Association for Molecular Pathology CMN working group recommended a core 34-gene set as a minimum target list for evaluation of CMNs. This list was recommended based on literature review, and its diagnostic yield in clinical practice is unknown. To determine the diagnostic yield of the core 34 genes and assess the potential impact of including selected additional genes. We retrospectively reviewed 185 patients with known or suspected CMNs tested using a 62-gene next-generation sequencing panel that included all 34 core genes. The Association for Molecular Pathology's core 34 genes had a diagnostic yield of 158 of 185 (85.4%) to detect at least 1 variant with strong/potential clinical significance and 107 of 185 (57.8%) to detect at least 2 such variants. The 62-gene panel had a diagnostic yield of 160 of 185 (86.5%) and 112 of 185 (60.5%), respectively. Variants of unknown significance were identified in 49 of 185 (26.5%) using the core 34 genes versus 76 of 185 (41.1%) using the 62-gene panel. This study demonstrates that the Association for Molecular Pathology-recommended core 34-gene set has a high diagnostic yield in CMNs. Inclusion of selected additional genes slightly increases the rate of abnormal results, while also increasing the detection of variants of unknown significance. We recommend inclusion of CUX1, DDX41, ETNK1, RIT1, and SUZ12 in addition to the Association for Molecular Pathology's 34-gene core set for routine evaluation of CMNs.</span>

A more reliable biomarker for SLE, which can play a critical role in either diagnosis, monitoring the disease progress or evaluating the response to treatment for individualized therapeutic, is necessary. DNA sensor is an important mediator of inflammation in systemic autoimmune diseases. However, the potential role for DNA sensor as disease activity biomarkers for SLE remained obscure. We detected the aberrant activation of DNA sensors and the corresponding IFN-β response in SLE patients, and to evaluate their potential role as disease biomarkers for SLE. We quantified the expressions of IFN-I and DNA sensor, such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, DAI and their down-stream adaptor STING in PBMC derived from patients with SLE (n = 100), healthy controls (HCs) (n = 62) by real-time PCR. The relationships between the expression of cGAS or IFI16 and clinical features in SLE patients were investigated. ROC curve analysis was performed to examine the predictive value of cGAS and IFI16 in SLE diagnosis, disease activity monitoring, specific organ manifestation and therapeutic response. RNA interference-mediated depletion of IFI16 or cGAS was conducted to evaluate their impact on IFN-I response. The expressions of cGAS and IFI16 were significantly higher in PBMC from SLE patients, closely correlated with the SLEDAI scores and high anti-dsDNA antibody titers. While the AUC for cGAS (0.767) was less than that of IFI16 and IFN-β, the AUC for IFI16 (0.856) and IFN-β (0.856) were similar. Expression of cGAS and IFI16 combine with IFN-β in PBMC showed high sensitivity (89.2%) and specificity (89.1%) for discrimination between mild and moderate/severe disease activity in SLE. Higher expression of IFI16 was association with ocular disorder in SLE patients. Neither IFI16 nor cGAS was a reliable indicator of therapeutic response. RNA interference-mediated depletion of IFI16 or cGAS prevented active SLE serum-induced upregulating in both IFN-α and IFN-β. High expression levels of cGAS and IFI16 in PBMC from SLE patients correlated strongly with disease activity. Both cGAS and IFI16 mediated signaling pathway were account for the robust production of IFN-β. Expression of cGAS and IFI16 combined with IFN-β in PBMC might serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring disease activity in SLE.</span>

Interestingly, these helicases constitute a major recurring family of RNA-binding proteins important for protecting the genome. Current studies have provided insight into the connection between genomic stability and several DEAD-box RNA helicase family proteins including DDX1, DDX3X, DDX5, DDX19, DDX21, DDX39B, and DDX41. For each helicase, we have reviewed evidence supporting their role in protecting the genome and their suggested mechanisms. Such helicases regulate the expression of factors promoting genomic stability, prevent DNA damage, and can participate directly in the response and repair of DNA damage. Finally, we summarized the pathological and therapeutic relationship between DEAD-box RNA helicases and cancer with respect to their novel role in genome stability.</span>

By targeted next-generation sequencing, we identified 28 patients (20 men and 8 women) with pathogenic germline DDX41 variants who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which only 3 (11%) had a family history (FH) of MNs. A subacute clinical course of cytopenia (mean duration of 11.2 months, range 0-72 months) prior to the initial AML diagnosis was accompanied by a low blast count (median at 30%, range 20-70%) in hypocellular marrows (93% of all patients), in vast contrast to the typical proliferative subtypes of AML in the elderly. Most patients had a normal karyotype (75%) and acquired a second DDX41 variant (69%). A favorable overall survival (OS) was observed in comparison to that of common subtypes of AML with wild-type DDX41 in age-matched patients. Our study demonstrated that the frequent germline pathogenic DDX41 variants characterized a clinically distinct AML entity. Features characteristic of DDX41-mutated AML include male predominance, often lack of FH, indolent course, low proliferative potential, frequent somatic DDX41 variants, and a favorable OS.</span>

Myeloid neoplasms (MN) with germline predisposition was identified as a distinct category in the 2016 WHO classification revision, including MN with germline DDX41 mutation. We retrospectively analyzed the molecular findings and clinical characteristics of thirty-three DDX41-mutated (mDDX41) patients at our institution. We identified 14 distinct pathogenic DDX41 variants in 32 patients and 8 DDX41 variants of unknown significance (VUS) in 9 patients. Five (16%) patients had a second DDX41 somatic mutation p.R525H and 13 (40%) had at least one additional oncogenic co-mutation in other genes. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 66 years, with male predominance (72%) and the majority of patients had normal cytogenetics (91%). Two-year overall survival (OS) was 86% and 6 (21%) MDS/AML patients with relatively preserved hematopoietic function were observed without further intervention. In comparison to AML patients with prognostically more favorable subtypes [t(8;21), n=27 and inv(16), n=40], mDDX41 patients in our cohort showed similarly favorable OS. Our study highlights that mDDX41-MN patients often have an indolent course and mDDX41-AML has comparable OS to favorable-risk AML.</span>

They can cause the development of AML at an earlier age, confer a higher risk of relapse or predispose to secondary leukemias, including therapy-related leukemias. The analysis of germline mutations in a patient and his/her family is also critical for the selection of suitable family donors if the patient is a candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 103 unrelated consecutive patients with de novo AML were enrolled in the study. Control group consisted of 103 persons from the general population. We performed NGS sequencing of bone marrow cells and buccal swabs DNA of six genes: CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, TERT, GATA2, and IDH2 to detect germline pathogenic mutations. In the investigated group, 49 variants were detected in six genes. 26 of them were somatic and 23 germline. Germline variants were detected in all six tested genes. Eight pathogenic germline mutations were detected in 7 AML patients, in three genes: CEBPA, ETV6, and IDH2. One patient had two pathogenic germinal mutations, one in ETV6 and one in CEBPA gene. We identified one novel pathogenic germline mutation in CEBPA gene. The difference in frequency of all pathogenic germline mutations between the tested (7.77 %) and control groups (0.97 %) was statistically significant (p = 0.046). In the tested group, the median age at AML diagnosis was 11 years lower in patients with pathogenic germline mutations than in patients without them (p = 0.028). We showed higher frequency of CEBPA, ETV6, and IDH2 germline mutations in AML patients than in control group, which confirms the role of these mutations in the development of AML. We also showed that the median age at the onset of AML in patients with pathogenic germline mutations is significantly lower than in patients without them.</span>

We analyzed the whole-exome sequencing data of paired leukemia and skin biopsy samples from 391 adult patients from the Beat AML 1.0 consortium. Using the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for variant interpretation, we curated 1547 unique variants from 228 genes. The pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants were identified in 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (13.6%) in 34 genes, including 6.39% (25/391) of patients harboring P/LP variants in genes considered clinically actionable (tier 1). 41.5% of the 53 patients with P/LP variants were in genes associated with the DNA damage response. The most frequently mutated genes were CHEK2 (8 patients) and DDX41 (7 patients). Pathogenic germline variants were also found in new candidate genes (DNAH5, DNAH9, DNMT3A, and SUZ12). No strong correlation was found between the germline mutational rate and age of AML onset. Among 49 patients who have a reported history of at least one family member affected with hematological malignancies, 6 patients harbored known P/LP germline variants and the remaining patients had at least one variant of uncertain significance, suggesting a need for further functional validation studies. Using CHEK2 as an example, we show that three-dimensional protein modeling can be one of the effective methodologies to prioritize variants of unknown significance for functional studies. Further, we evaluated an in silico approach that applies ACMG curation in an automated manner using the tool for assessment and (TAPES) prioritization in exome studies, which can minimize manual curation time for variants. Overall, our findings suggest a need to comprehensively understand the predisposition potential of many germline variants in order to enable closer monitoring for disease management and treatment interventions for affected patients and families.</span>

The majority of affected individuals harbor germline monoallelic frameshift DDX41 mutations and subsequently acquire somatic mutations in their other DDX41 allele, typically missense R525H. Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with biallelic frameshift and R525H mutations undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, causing bone marrow failure in mice. Mechanistically, DDX41 is essential for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) processing, ribosome assembly, and protein synthesis. Although monoallelic DDX41 mutations do not affect hematopoiesis in young mice, a subset of aged mice develops features of MDS. Biallelic mutations in DDX41 are observed at a low frequency in non-dominant hematopoietic stem cell clones in bone marrow (BM) from individuals with MDS. Mice chimeric for monoallelic DDX41 mutant BM cells and a minor population of biallelic mutant BM cells develop hematopoietic defects at a younger age, suggesting that biallelic DDX41 mutant cells are disease modifying in the context of monoallelic DDX41 mutant BM.</span>

Nevertheless, their clinical implications of RBPs in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely undefined. Here, this study systematically analyzed the associations of RBPs with HBV-related HCC prognosis. Based on differentially expressed RBPs between HBV-related HCC and control specimens, prognosis-related RBPs were screened by univariate analyses. A LASSO model was then created. Kaplan-Meier curves, ROCs, multivariate analyses, subgroup analyses and external verification were separately applied to assess the efficacy of this model in predicting prognosis and recurrence of patients. A nomogram was created by incorporating the model and clinical indicators, which was verified by ROCs, calibration curves and decision curve analyses. By CIBERSORT algorithm, the association between the risk score and immune cell infiltrations was evaluated. Totally, 54 RBPs were distinctly correlated to prognosis of HBV-related HCC. An 11-RBP model was created, containing POLR2L, MRPS12, DYNLL1, ZFP36, PPIH, RARS, SRP14, DDX41, EIF2B4, and NOL12. This risk score sensitively and accurately predicted one-, three- and five-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free interval. Compared to other clinical parameters, this risk score had the best predictive efficacy. Also, the clinical generalizability of the model was externally verified in the GSE14520 dataset. The nomogram may predict patients' survival probabilities. Also, the risk score was related to the components in the immune microenvironment. Collectively, RBPs may act as critical elements in the malignant progression of HBV-related HCC and possess potential implications on prognostication and therapy decision.</span>

In this study, we present clinical and genomic data on 144 Mayo Clinic patients with GPS; 59 evaluated prospectively using an algorithm-based diagnostic approach in the setting of a dedicated GPS/ inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) clinic. Seventy-two (50%) patients had IBMFS (telomere biology disorders-32,Fanconi anemia-18, Diamond Blackfan Anemia - 11, congenital neutropenia-5, Schwachman-Diamond Syndrome-5 and Bloom Syndrome-1), 27 (19%) had GPS with antecedent thrombocytopenia (RUNX1-FPD-15, ANKRD26-6, ETV6-2, GATA1-1, MPL-3), 28 (19%) had GPS without antecedent thrombocytopenia (GATA2 haploinsufficiency-16, DDX41-10, CBL-1 and CEBPA-1) and 17 (12%) had general cancer predisposition syndromes (ataxia telangiectasia-7, heterozygous ATM variants-3, CHEK2-2, TP53-2, CDK2NA-1, NF1-1 and Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome-1). Homozygous and heterozygous ATM pathogenic variants were exclusively associated with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD), while DDX41 GPS was associated with LPD and myeloid neoplasms. The use of somatic NGS-testing identified clonal evolution in GPS patients, with ASXL1, RAS pathway genes, SRSF2 and TET2 being most frequently mutated. Fifty-two (91%) of 59 prospectively identified GPS patients had a change in their management approach, including additional GPS-related screening in 42 (71%), referral for allogenic HSCT workup and screening of related donors in 16 (27%), medication initiation and selection of specific conditioning regimens in 14 (24%), and genetic counseling with specific intent of fertility preservation and preconceptual counseling in 10 (17%) patients; highlighting the importance of dedicated GPS screening, detection and management programs for patients with hematological neoplasms.</span>

In this study, "&lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt;" was searched in &lt;i&gt;PubMed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Web of Science&lt;/i&gt; between 1 January 2015 and 29 April 2021 with individual-patient data seeking. A meta-analysis was not valid here due to the absence of a large dataset. Thirty articles were finally included in the qualitative analysis and 277 patients from 20 studies without overlap were involved in the quantitative summary. Pooled incidence was 3.3% (95% confidence interval 2.4-4.2%) of unselected myeloid neoplasms. Patients with hematologic disorders harboring mutated &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; were featured as 80% males, median 66 (20-88) years old at diagnosis, 75% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 64% with normal karyotype. Eighty-five percent of patients had germline variants which were nationally diverse and more of frameshift type, whereas 64% of patients had somatic &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; variants where p.R525H and missense dominated. &lt;i&gt;ASXL1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; were the top frequent concomitant somatic mutations. Therapeutically, 70% overall response rate was obtained of hypomethylating agents in MDS, 96% complete remission of chemotherapy in AML, and 8% of relapse in hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Neither overall survival nor progression-free survival could be summed. Several significant clinical differences were observed in different diagnosis groups, familial and sporadic cases, and p.R525H compared with other somatic variants. In conclusion, myeloid neoplasms carrying &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutations were mainly older, male, MDS, and AML patients who had promising responses to treatment. Both germline and somatic &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; variants possessed unique characteristics and groups of interest presented certain differences worth further research. (CRD42021228886).</span>

In addition to pediatric subjects, adult patients were analyzed in order to obtain a complete spectrum of driver mutations in germline cells and/or somatic tumor samples. As shown in several recent studies, such driver mutations are acquired in a gene-specific fashion. DDX41 mutations are observed in germline cells long before MDS presentation. SAMD9/SAMD9L germline mutations associated with defective hematopoiesis account for recurrent and familial -7/del (7q) lesions, which result in the removal of the disadvantageous allele. Additionally, MDS cases in younger population display compound heterozygous germline mutations in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome-associated SBDS gene. In peripheral blood samples from healthy elderly individuals, DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 somatic mutations are usually detected due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis and are considered to be a risk factor for hematological neoplasms. In MDS, mutations of genes, such as NRAS and FLT3, designated as type-1 genes, are significantly associated with leukemic evolution. On the other hand, mutations in type-2 genes, including RUNX1 and GATA2, are related to progression from low risk MDS to high risk MDS.</span>

We identified DDX41 mutations from a cohort of known or suspected hematologic disorders and reviewed the corresponding clinical, genetic, phenotypic, and morphologic findings. DDX41 mutations were identified in 20 (1.4%) of 1,371 cases, including 8 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 2 cases of therapy-related MDS/AML, 1 case of primary myelofibrosis, 1 case of chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 case of clonal cytopenia of uncertain significance (CCUS), 1 case of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL), and 1 case of multiple myeloma. DDX41-mutated neoplasms were morphologically heterogeneous with a median cellularity of 20% (range, 10%-100%). Megakaryocyte dysplasia occurred in 7 (35%) of 20 cases and trilineage dysplasia in 1 (5%). Frequently comutated genes include a second, somatic DDX41 mutation (8/19, 42%) followed by mutations in TET2 (20%), DNMT3A (20%), ASXL1 (20%), and CUX1 (20%). Karyotypes were noncomplex in 17 (89%) of 19. This report extends the spectrum of DDX41-mutated disorders to include CCUS, T-LGL, and plasma cell disorders. The morphologic features are heterogeneous and nonspecific, highlighting the importance of DDX41 testing during routine workup of hematolymphoid neoplasms.</span>

We analyzed 45 known cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) in germline samples of 202 patients with hematological malignancies (HMs) plus one or more other independent cancer managed at major tertiary medical centers on two different continents. This included 120 patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs), where the HM occurred after cytotoxic treatment for a first malignancy, and 82 patients with multiple cancers in which the HM was not preceded by cytotoxic therapy (MC-HM). Using American College of Medical Genetics/Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification guidelines, 13% of patients had PGVs, most frequently identified in CHEK2 (17% of PGVs), BRCA1 (13%), DDX41 (13%), and TP53 (7%). The frequency of PGVs in MC-HM was higher than in t-MN, although not statistically significant (18 vs. 9%; p = 0.085). The frequency of PGVs in lymphoid and myeloid HM patients was similar (19 vs. 17.5%; p &amp;gt; 0.9). Critically, patients with PGVs in BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 did not satisfy current clinical phenotypic criteria for germline testing. Our data suggest that a personal history of multiple cancers, one being a HM, should trigger screening for PGVs.</span>

Using an in vivo model of Ddx41 deficiency, we unveiled a critical role for this helicase in regulating erythropoiesis. We demonstrated that loss of ddx41 leads to anemia caused by diminished proliferation and defective differentiation of erythroid progenitors. Mis-expression and alternative splicing of cell cycle genes is rampant in ddx41 mutant erythroid progenitors. We delineated that the DNA damage response is activated in mutant cells resulting in an Ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-triggered cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of these kinases partially suppressed ddx41 mutant anemia. These findings establish a critical function for Ddx41 in promoting healthy erythropoiesis via protection from genomic stress and delineate a mechanistic framework to explore a role for ATM and ATR signaling in DDX41-mutant hematopoietic pathologies.</span>

In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that several family members are multitasking enzymes. They are often involved in different processes, which may be typical for RNA helicases, such as RNA export and translation, or atypical, e.g., acting as nucleic acid sensors that activate downstream innate immune signaling. This review focuses on the DEAD-box protein DDX41 and summarizes our current understanding of its roles as an innate immunity sensor in the cytosol and in pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and discusses DDX41's involvement in disease.</span>

The awareness of germline susceptibility has increased, and some patients with myeloid neoplasms present with a preexisting disorder or organ dysfunction. In such cases, mutations in genes including CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (CEBPA), DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 41 (DDX41), RUNX family transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and ETS variant transcription factor 6 (ETV6) have been recognized. Moreover, with the application of advanced technologies and reports of more cases, additional germline mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms have been identified and provide insights into the formation, prognosis and therapy of myeloid neoplasms. The present review discusses the well-known CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, GATA2, JAK2 and ETV6 germline mutations, and other mutations including those of lymphocyte adapter protein/SH2B adapter protein 3 and duplications of autophagy related 2B, GSK3B interacting protein αnd RB binding protein 6, ubiquitin ligase, that remain to be confirmed or explored. Recommendations for the management of diseases associated with germline mutations are also provided.</span>

Human studies suggest mechanistic conservation for inflammation in DDX41-associated hematologic disease, uncovering a potential route for future therapeutic intervention.</span>

Nonetheless, roughly 30% of such patients have leukemia recurrence and up to 2% of these are donor-derived leukemias, in which malignancy develops in the donor's transplanted cells, despite extremely low rates of leukemia in the donors themselves. Notably, over 20% of these malignancies carry chromosome 7 abnormalities nearly all of which are monosomies. Recent advances in whole exome and genome sequencing have allowed for detection of candidate genes that likely contribute to the development of AML in donor cells (donor leukemia, DCL). These genes include CEBPA, GATA2, JAK2, RUNX1, DDX41, EZH2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, XPD, XRCC3, and CHEK1. The potential roles of variants in these genes are evaluated based on familial clustering of MDS/AML and corresponding animal studies demonstrating their leukemogenic nature. This review describes the spectrum of genetic aberrations detected in DCL cases in the literature with regard to the character of the individual cases, existing family cohorts that carry individual genes, and functional studies that support etiologic roles in AML development. DCL presents a unique opportunity to examine genetic variants in the donors and recipients with regards to progression to malignancy.</span>

Tight regulation of HSPC numbers is critical for hematopoietic homeostasis. Here, we identified DEAD-box helicase 41 (Ddx41) as a gatekeeper of HSPC production. Using zebrafish ddx41 mutants, we unveiled a critical role for this helicase in regulating HSPC production at the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. We determined that Ddx41 suppresses the accumulation of R-loops, nucleic acid structures consisting of RNA:DNA hybrids and ssDNAs whose equilibrium is essential for cellular fitness. Excess R-loop levels in ddx41 mutants triggered the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway leading to increased numbers of hemogenic endothelium and HSPCs. Elevated R-loop accumulation and inflammatory signaling were observed in human cells with decreased DDX41, suggesting possible conservation of mechanism. These findings delineate that precise regulation of R-loop levels during development is critical for limiting cGAS-STING activity and HSPC numbers.</span>

However, the role of DDX41 in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In order to determine the function of DDX41, the human DDX41 gene was cloned and overexpressed in HeLa cells. The present study demonstrated that DDX41 overexpression inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in HeLa cells. RNA‑sequencing analysis of the transcriptomes in overexpressed and normal control samples. DDX41 regulated 959 differentially expressed genes compared with control cells. Expression levels of certain oncogenes were also regulated by DDX41. DDX41 selectively regulated the alternative splicing of genes in cancer‑associated pathways including the EGFR and FGFR signaling pathways. DDX41 selectively upregulated the expression levels of five antigen processing and presentation genes (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA6, HLA‑DMB and HLA‑G) and downregulated other immune‑response genes in HeLa cells. Additionally, DDX41‑regulated oncogenes and antigen processing and presentation genes were associated with patient survival rates. Moreover, DDX41 expression was associated with immune infiltration in cervical and endocervical squamous cancer. The present findings showed that DDX41 regulated the cancer cell transcriptome at both the transcriptional and alternative splicing levels. The DDX41 regulatory network predicted the biological function of DDX41 in suppressing tumor cell growth and regulating cancer immunity, which may be important for developing anticancer therapeutics.</span>

We investigated the incidence, genetic characteristics, and clinical features of DDX41 mutations in Korean patients with ICUS, MDS, or AML. We performed targeted deep sequencing of 61 genes including DDX41 in 457 patients with ICUS (n=75), MDS (n=210), or AML (n=172). Germline DDX41 mutations with causality were identified in 28 (6.1%) patients, of whom 27 (96.4%) had somatic mutations in the other position of DDX41. Germline origins of the DDX41 mutations were confirmed in all of the 11 patients in whom germline-based testing was performed. Of the germline DDX41 mutations, p.V152G (n=10) was most common, followed by p.Y259C (n=8), p.A500fs (n=6), and p.E7* (n=3). Compared with non-mutated patients, patients with a DDX41 mutation were more frequently male, older, had a normal karyotype, low leukocyte count, and hypocellular marrow at diagnosis. Three of the four ICUS patients with germline DDX41 mutations progressed to MDS. The incidence of DDX41 mutations in Korean patients was high and there was a distinct mutation pattern, in that p.V152G was a unique germline variant. ICUS harboring germline DDX41 mutations may be regarded as a hereditary myeloid neoplasm. Germline DDX41 mutations are not uncommon and should be explored when treating patients with myeloid malignancies.</span>

Germline mutations in the RNA helicase &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; predispose to increased lifetime risks of myeloid neoplasms with disease often occurring later in life which presents challenges for germline recognition. To improve identification of germline &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, individuals presenting with ≥1 &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; alteration on an institutional MDS/AML next-generation sequencing based panel with at least one at &amp;gt;40% variant allele frequency were flagged for review and genetic counseling referral. Of 5,801 individuals, 90 (1.5%) had ≥1 &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutation(s) identified. Thirty-eight (42%) patients with a median age of 66 years were referred for genetic counseling; thirty-one were male (81.5%). Thirty-five (92%) referred patients elected to pursue germline evaluation and in 33/35 (94%) a germline &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; variant was confirmed. Twenty-two patients (66%) with germline variants reported antecedent cytopenias, seven (21%) had a prior history of malignancy, and twenty-seven (82%) reported a family history of cancer. Predictive genetic testing for healthy family members under consideration as stem cell transplant donors was successfully performed in 11 family members, taking an average of 15 days. Near-heterozygous &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutations identified on next-generation sequencing, particularly nonsense/frameshift variants or those at recurrent germline "hot spots" are highly suggestive of a germline mutation. Next-generation sequencing screening is a feasible tool to screen unselected myeloid neoplasms for germline &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; mutations, enabling timely and appropriate care.</span>

Many of the genes involved in MNGP are also recurrently mutated in sporadic MN. Therefore, routine analysis of gene panels by next-generation sequencing provides an effective approach to detect germline variants with clinical significance in patients with hematological malignancies. Gene panel sequencing was performed in 88 consecutive and five nonconsecutive patients with MN diagnosis. Disease-causing germline mutations in CEBPα, ASXL1, TP53, MPL, GATA2, DDX41, and ETV6 genes were identified in nine patients. Six out of the nine patients with germline variants had a strong family history. These patients presented great heterogeneity in the age of diagnosis and phenotypic characteristics. In our study, there were families in which all the affected members presented the same subtype of disease, whereas members of other families presented various disease phenotypes. This intrafamiliar heterogeneity suggests that the acquisition of particular somatic variants may drive the evolution of the disease. This approach enabled high-throughput detection of MNGP in patients with MN diagnosis, which is of great relevance for both the patients themselves and the asymptomatic mutation carriers within the family. It is crucial to make a proper diagnosis of these patients to provide them with the most suitable treatment, follow-up, and genetic counseling.</span>

Endogenous retroviruses (ERV) account for 8 to 10% of the human and mouse genomes and play an important role in some biological processes of animals. Recent studies indicate that the activation of ERV can affect the expression of the immunity- or inflammation-related genes, and the activities of ERV are subjected to regulation of many factors including nutritional factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that nutritional status can affect the expression of the immunity- or inflammation-related genes via ERV. To verify this hypothesis, the nutritional status of animals was altered by fasting or overfeeding, and the expression of intact ERV (ERVK18P, ERVK25P) and immunity- or inflammation-related genes (DDX41, IFIH1, IFNG, IRF7, STAT3) in the liver was determined by quantitative PCR, followed by overexpressing ERVK25P in goose primary hepatocytes and determining the expression of the immunity- or inflammation-related genes. The data showed that compared with the control group (no fasting), the expression of ERV and the immunity- or inflammation-related genes was increased in the liver of the fasted chickens but decreased in the liver of the fasted geese. Moreover, compared with the control group (routinely fed), the expression of ERV and the immunity- or inflammation-related genes was increased in the liver of the overfed geese. In addition, overexpression of ERVK25P in goose primary hepatocytes can induce the expression of the immunity- or inflammation-related genes. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ERV mediate the effects of fasting and overfeeding on the expression of the immunity- or inflammation-related genes, the mediation varied with poultry species, and ERV and the immunity- or inflammation-related genes may be involved in the development of goose fatty liver. This study provides a potential mechanism for the connection between nutrition and immunity.</span>

The innate immune system utilizes numerous germ-line encoded receptors called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral nucleic acids, ultimately resulting in antiviral immune responses in the form of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The immune-stimulatory role of DNA is known for a long time; however, DNA sensing ability of the innate immune system was unraveled only recently. At present, multiple DNA sensors have been proposed, and most of them use STING as a key adaptor protein to exert antiviral immune responses. In this review, we aim to provide molecular and structural underpinnings on endosomal DNA sensor Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and multiple cytosolic DNA sensors including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), interferon-gamma inducible 16 (IFI16), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI) to provide new insights on their signaling mechanisms and physiological relevance. We have also addressed less well-understood DNA sensors such as DEAD-box helicase DDX41, RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and meiotic recombination 11 homolog A (MRE11). By comprehensive understanding of molecular and structural aspects of DNA-sensing antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, potential new targets for viral and autoimmune diseases can be identified.</span>

In this Review, we highlight the different genetic pathways impacted by germline mutations that can ultimately lead to the development of familial and sporadic haematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Many of the genes disrupted by somatic mutations in these diseases (for example, TP53, RUNX1, IKZF1 and ETV6) are the same as those that harbour germline mutations in children and adolescents who develop these malignancies. Moreover, the presumption that familial leukaemias only present in childhood is no longer true, in large part due to the numerous studies demonstrating germline DDX41 mutations in adults with MDS and AML. Lastly, we highlight how different cooperating events can influence the ultimate phenotype in these different familial leukaemia syndromes.</span>

Studies have shown that the DNA sensor-STING-interferon (IFN)-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; pathway plays an important role in the defense against intracellular invasion of many DNA viruses. However, the intracellular recognition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by DNA sensors is still largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the DNA sensor-STING pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be activated by acute and chronic HBV infections in humans. We first evaluated the expression of these DNA sensors in PBMCs of acute and chronic HBV-infected patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We next compared the expression of the upregulated DNA sensor between monocytes and nonmonocytes to find its cellular source. Finally, by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; stimulation, we analyzed the IFN-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; response of the DNA sensor-STING pathway in PBMCs and monocytes from chronic HBV-infected patients. The results showed that IFI16, DDX41, MRE11, and the adaptor STING were upregulated in chronic HBV-infected patients, whereas only IFI16 was upregulated in acute HBV-infected patients. However, IFN-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; expression was not changed in PBMCs from acute and chronic HBV-infected patients. We next found IFI16 was mainly expressed in monocytes of acute and chronic hepatitis B patients. Finally, by stimulation of monocytes with VACV ds 70mer, a ligand for IFI16, we confirmed the attenuated response of the IFI16-STING pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV might be sensed by DNA sensors in PBMCs of acute and chronic HBV-infected patients, and meanwhile HBV infection attenuates the response of the DNA sensor-STING pathway in PBMCs and monocytes, which may facilitate the persistence of HBV infection.</span>

The revised 2016 WHO classification introduced a novel category of "myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition" with GATA2, CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26 and ETV6 genes expanding the spectrum of hereditary myeloid neoplasms (MN). Since then, more germline causes of MN were identified, including SAMD9, SAMD9L, and ERCC6L2. This review describes the genetic and clinical spectrum of predisposition to MN. The main focus lies in delineation of phenotypes, genetics and management of GATA2 deficiency and the novel SAMD9/SAMD9L-related disorders. Combined, GATA2 and SAMD9/SAMD9L (SAMD9/9L) syndromes are recognized as most frequent causes of primary paediatric myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly in setting of monosomy 7. To date, ~550 cases with germline GATA2 mutations, and ~130 patients with SAMD9/9L mutations had been reported in literature. GATA2 deficiency is a highly penetrant disorder with a progressive course that often rapidly necessitates bone marrow transplantation. In contrast, SAMD9/9L disorders show incomplete penetrance with various clinical outcomes ranging from spontaneous haematological remission observed in young children to malignant progression.</span>

Yield of genetic testing and phenotypic spectra for TBDs caused by the expanding list of telomere genes in adults remain understudied. Thus, we screened adults aged ≥18 years with a personal and/or family history clustering hematologic disorders and/or ILD enrolled on The University of Chicago Inherited Hematologic Disorders Registry for causative variants in 13 TBD genes. Sixteen (10%) of 153 probands carried causative variants distributed among TERT (n = 6), TERC (n = 4), PARN (n = 5), or RTEL1 (n = 1), of which 19% were copy number variants. The highest yield (9 of 22 [41%]) was in families with mixed hematologic and ILD presentations, suggesting that ILD in hematology populations and hematologic abnormalities in ILD populations warrant TBD genetic testing. Four (3%) of 117 familial hematologic disorder families without ILD carried TBD variants, making TBD second to only DDX41 in frequency for genetic diagnoses in this population. Phenotypes of 17 carriers with heterozygous PARN variants included 4 (24%) with hematologic abnormalities, 67% with lymphocyte telomere lengths measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization at or above the 10th percentile, and a high penetrance for ILD. Alternative etiologies for cytopenias and/or ILD such as autoimmune features were noted in multiple TBD families, emphasizing the need to maintain clinical suspicion for a TBD despite the presence of alternative explanations.</span>

The host response to viral and bacterial infection involves sets of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which bind evolutionarily conserved pathogen structures, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recent advances in the identification of different types of PRRs in teleost fish revealed a number of cytosolic sensors for recognition of viral and bacterial nucleic acids. These are DExD/H-box RNA helicases including a group of well-characterized retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and non-RLR DExD/H-box RNA helicases (e.g., DDX1, DDX3, DHX9, DDX21, DHX36 and DDX41) both involved in recognition of viral RNAs. Another group of PRRs includes cytosolic DNA sensors (CDSs), such as cGAS and LSm14A involved in recognition of viral and intracellular bacterial dsDNAs. Moreover, dsRNA-sensing protein kinase R (PKR), which has a role in antiviral immune responses in higher vertebrates, has been identified in fish. Additionally, fish possess a novel PKR-like protein kinase containing Z-DNA binding domain, known as PKZ. Here, we review the current knowledge concerning cytosolic sensors for recognition of viral and bacterial nucleic acids in teleosts.</span>

Recently, studies revealed that self-DNA from by-products of chromosome instability and tumors could activate the cGAS-STING pathway, and subsequently promote or inhibit tumor development. However, the prognostic value and correlations with immune infiltrates of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In the present study, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, Oncomine, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource databases. Overexpression of XRCC5, IRF3, TRIM21, STAT6, DDX41, TBK1, XRCC6, TREX1, PRKDC, and TMEM173 was markedly correlated with clinical stages and pathological grades in HCC. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of XRCC5, XRCC6, and PRKDC was significantly related with shorter overall survival. However, higher mRNA expression of IFI16, STAT6, NLRC3, and TMEM173 was associated with favorable overall survival. Our results suggested that the kinase targets of the cGAS-STING pathway included the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK and LYN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family kinases (ATM and ATR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Furthermore, we identified significant correlations among the expression of cGAS-STING pathway and infiltration of B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in HCC. The expression of the cGAS-STING pathway also exhibited strong relationships with diverse immune marker sets in HCC. These findings suggest that cGAS-STING pathway members may be used as prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets HCC patients.</span>

However, the causes of aberrant AS in breast cancer are poorly understood. In this study, the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) data were analysed with univariate feature selection. Of 122 analysed spliceosome components, &lt;i&gt;U2SURP, PUF60, DDX41, HNRNPAB, EIF4A3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PPIL3&lt;/i&gt; were significantly associated with breast cancer survival. The top 4 four genes, &lt;i&gt;U2SURP, PUF60, DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt;, were chosen for further analyses. Their expression was significantly associated with cancer molecular subtype, tumour stage, tumour grade, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival in the METABRIC data. These results were verifiable using other cohorts. The Cancer Genome Atlas data unveiled the elevated expression of &lt;i&gt;PUF60, DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt; in tumours compared with the normal tissue and confirmed the differential expression of the four genes among cancer molecular subtypes, as well as the associations of &lt;i&gt;U2SURP, PUF60&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; expression with tumour stage. A meta-analysis data verified the associations of &lt;i&gt;U2SURP, PUF60&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt; expression with tumour grade, the associations of &lt;i&gt;PUF60, DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt; expression with OS and distant metastasis-free survival, and the associations of &lt;i&gt;U2SURP&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt; expression with relapse-free survival. Experimentally, we demonstrated that inhibiting the expression of the four genes separately suppressed cell colony formation and slowed down cell growth considerably in breast cancer cells, but not in immortal breast epithelial cells. In conclusion, we have identified &lt;i&gt;U2SURP, PUF60, DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNRNPAB&lt;/i&gt; are spliceosome-related genes pivotal for breast cancer survival.</span>

With the recent advances in sequencing technology and the growing body of knowledge on the genetics of AML, there is increasing concern about cancer predisposing germline mutations as well as somatic mutations. As familial cases sharing germline mutations are constantly reported, germline predisposition gene mutations in patients with AML are gaining attention. We performed genomic sequencing of Korean patients diagnosed with AML to identify the prevalence and characteristics of germline predisposition mutations. Among 180 patients, germline predisposition mutations were identified in 13 patients (13/180, 7.2%, eight adults and five children). Germline mutations of BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CTC1, DDX41, ERCC4, ERCC6, FANCI, FANCM, PALB2, and SBDS were identified. Most of the mutations are in genes involved in DNA repair and genomic stability maintenance. Patients harboring germline mutations tended to have earlier onset of AML (p = 0.005), however, the presence of germline mutations did not showed significant association with other clinical characteristics or treatment outcome. Since each mutation was rare, further study with a larger number of cases would be needed to establish the effect of the mutations.</span>

Fish DDX41 shares some similar properties with the mammalian counterparts. In this study, a DDX41 orthologous gene from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) (CiDDX41) was cloned and characterized. The ORF of CiDDX41 encodes a polypeptide of 614 amino acids. Multiple alignments showed that DDX41 is highly conserved among different species. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that CiDDX41 shares a high degree of homology with Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous DDX41. CiDDX41 is highly expressed in kidney, intestines, liver and spleen. Their expressions are up-regulated more obviously after the treatment with GCRV. Over-expression of CiDDX41 in CIK cells increases the transcription level of grass carp IFN I and ISG15. On the contrary, knockdown of CiDDX41 inhibits the IFN I and ISG15 transcription. Moreover, a part of CiDDX41 translocates from the nuclear to cytoplasm to interact with grass carp STING (CiSTING). In CIK cells, overexpression of CiDDX41 and CiSTING can promote the phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasm translocation of grass carp IRF7 (CiIRF7) and then acutely up-regulate the IFN I and ISG15 expression. However, the knockdown of CiDDX41 inhibits the phosphorylation IRF7. Taken together, all these results above suggested that CiDDX41 performs as an activator for innate immune through STING-IRF7 mediated signaling pathway.</span>

We conducted a multicenter prospective clinical sequencing study to verify the feasibility of a panel test for hematological tumors, including acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Out of 96 eligible patients, 79 patients (82%) showed potentially actionable findings, based on the clinical sequencing assays. We identified that genetic alterations with a strong clinical significance were found at a higher frequency in terms of diagnosis (n = 60; 63%) and prognosis (n = 61; 64%) than in terms of therapy (n = 8; 8%). Three patients who harbored a germline mutation in either DDX41 (n = 2) or BRCA2 (n = 1) were provided with genetic counseling. At 6 mo after sequencing, clinical actions based on the diagnostic (n = 5) or prognostic (n = 3) findings were reported, but no patients were enrolled in a clinical trial or received targeted therapies based on the sequencing results. These results suggest that panel testing for hematological malignancies would be feasible given the availability of useful diagnostic and prognostic information.

Familial clustering was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6, among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms. However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.</span>

The most common germline variants included Splice c.935 + 4A&amp;gt;T, p.T360Ifs*33, p.V152G, p.S217Ifs*4, p.R311* and p.R369*. Except for the p.R369*, no other variants have been previously reported. Clinical covariates of subjects with simple DDX41 somatic variants and germline/somatic biallelic variants are similar. The two-year overall survival (OS) of subjects with DDX41 variants was 85%. Overall response rate to demethylation therapy in subjects with DDX41 variants was 69%. The response did not correlate with the presence of a germline variant.</span>

Current knowledge has shown the presence of antigen presenting cells (APCs) involving in B and T cells at the muscle injection site and the upregulation of type I interferon (IFN-I) that initiates antiviral response and benefits adaptive immunity in fish DNA vaccines. IFN-I may be triggered by expressed antigen such as the rhabdovirus G protein encoded DNA vaccine or by plasmid DNA itself through cytosolic DNA sensing. The investigating of Toll-like receptor 9, and 21 are the CpG-motif sensors in many fish species, and the cytosolic DNA receptors DDX41 and downstream STING signaling revealed the mechanisms for IFN-I production. This review article describes the recent finding of receptors for cytosolic DNA, the STING-TBK1-IRF signaling, and the possibility of turning these findings into strategies for the future development of DNA vaccines.</span>

However, little information is available regarding the function of fish DDX41. In this study, a DDX41 gene, named On-DDX41, was identified in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The predicted protein of On-DDX41 contains several structural features known in DDX41, including conserved DEADc and HELICc domains, and a conserved sequence "Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (D-E-A-D)". On-DDX41 gene was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression level observed in liver and muscle, and was inducible after poly(I:C) stimulation. Moreover, the overexpression of On-DDX41 can elicit a strong activation of both zebrafish IFN1 and IFN3 promoter in fish cells treated with poly(dA:dT). The present study thus contributes to a better understanding of the functional properties of DDX41 in fish.</span>

DDX41/Abstrakt is a metazoan-specific spliceosomal DEAD-box RNA helicase that is recurrently mutated in inherited myelodysplastic syndromes and in relapsing cases of AML. The genetic properties and genomic impacts of disease-causing missense mutations in DDX41 and other spliceosomal proteins have been uncertain. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; DDX41 ortholog, SACY-1 Biochemical analyses defined SACY-1 as a component of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; spliceosome, and genetic analyses revealed synthetic lethal interactions with spliceosomal components. We used the auxin-inducible degradation system to analyze the consequence of SACY-1 depletion on the transcriptome using RNA sequencing. SACY-1 depletion impacts the transcriptome through splicing-dependent and splicing-independent mechanisms. Altered 3' splice site usage represents the predominant splicing defect observed upon SACY-1 depletion, consistent with a role for SACY-1 in the second step of splicing. Missplicing events appear more prevalent in the soma than the germline, suggesting that surveillance mechanisms protect the germline from aberrant splicing. The transcriptome changes observed after SACY-1 depletion suggest that disruption of the spliceosome induces a stress response, which could contribute to the cellular phenotypes conferred by &lt;i&gt;sacy-1&lt;/i&gt; mutant alleles. Multiple &lt;i&gt;sacy-1&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;/ddx41&lt;/i&gt; missense mutations, including the R525H human oncogenic variant, confer antimorphic activity, suggesting that their incorporation into the spliceosome is detrimental. Antagonistic variants that perturb the function of the spliceosome may be relevant to the disease-causing mutations, including DDX41, affecting highly conserved components of the spliceosome in humans.</span>

In addition to this infectious phenotype, at least one third of the patients experience autoimmune, autoinflammatory, granulomatous, and/or malignant complications. The very heterogeneous presentation strongly suggests a collection of different disease entities with somewhat different pathogeneses and most likely diverse genetic etiologies. Major progress has been made during recent years with the advent and introduction of next-generation sequencing, initially for research purposes, but more recently in clinical practice. In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing on 20 CVID patients with autoimmunity, autoinflammation, and/or malignancy from the Danish CVID cohort with the aim to identify gene variants with a certain, possible, or potential disease-causing role in CVID. Through bioinformatics analyses, we identified variants with possible/probable disease-causing potential in nine of the patients. Of these, three patients had four variants in three different genes classified as likely pathogenic (&lt;i&gt;NFKB1, TNFAIP3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TTC37&lt;/i&gt;), whereas in six patients, we identified seven variants of possible pathogenic potential classified as variants of unknown significance (&lt;i&gt;STAT3, IL17F, IRAK4, DDX41, NLRC3, TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PLCG2&lt;/i&gt;). In the remaining 11 patients, we did not identify possible genetic causes. Genetic findings were correlated to clinical disease presentation, clinical immunological phenotype, and disease complications. We suggest that the variants identified in the present work should lay the ground for future studies to functionally validate their disease-causing potential and to investigate at the mechanistic and molecular level their precise role in CVID pathogenesis. Overall, we believe that the present work contributes important new insights into the genetic basis of CVID and particular in the subset of CVID patients with a complex phenotype involving not only infection, but also autoimmunity, autoinflammation, and malignancy.</span>

The inappropriate localization of DNA within the cell cytosol or endosomal compartments indicates that a cell may either be infected by a DNA virus or bacterium, or has problems with its own nuclear integrity. This DNA is sensed by certain receptors that mediate cytokine production and, in some cases, initiate an inflammatory and lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis. Dysregulation of these DNA-sensing pathways is thought to contribute to autoimmune diseases and the development of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the DNA sensors Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and interferon gamma-inducible 16 (IFI16), their ligands, and their physiological significance. We will also examine the less-well-understood DEAH- and DEAD-box helicases DHX9, DHX36, DDX41, and RNA polymerase III, each of which may play an important role in DNA-mediated innate immunity.</span>

They are critical to trigger immune response against DNA viral and intracellular bacterial infection, and are involved in inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis. Recent accumulating evidences indicated that DNA sensors are also crucial for controlling the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, a systematic study on the expression profile of DNA sensors in CRC and their clinical significance are still lacking. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the expression profile of DNA sensors in CRC and their clinical significance by taking advantage of clinical CRC samples, mouse AOM/DSS treatment model, and Oncomine ® bioinformatics platform. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Our study identified that the expression of DNA sensors, including &lt;i&gt;AIM2, DAI,&lt;/i&gt; as well as inflammasome molecules &lt;i&gt;ASC/IL-18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TLR9&lt;/i&gt; and adaptor &lt;i&gt;MyD88&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DDX60&lt;/i&gt; decreased in human CRC, whereas the expression of &lt;i&gt;DHX9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DHX36&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; significantly increased. Among them, the expression of &lt;i&gt;AIM2/ASC/IL-18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MyD88&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DAI&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DHX36&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DDX60&lt;/i&gt; were associated with cancer stages. In addition, we also performed correlation analysis between DNA sensors and their main signaling molecules to explore the possible mechanisms. The results showed that there were positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;AIM2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ASC/IL-18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DHX9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MAVS&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TLR9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MyD88&lt;/i&gt; expression. In addition, the gene expression patterns of some DNA sensors were confirmed by Western-blot analysis. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Our study revealed that the expression of multiple DNA sensors was deregulated in CRC and might be involved in tumor development. More importantly, the study identified that, among all these DNA sensors, AIM2, DAI, and DDX60 could be potentially critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of CRC and deserve further investigation.</span>

Previous studies on the role of TRIM21 in innate immune responses have yielded contradictory results, suggesting that the role of TRIM21 is cell specific. Here, we report that bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) generated from Trim21&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have reduced expression of mature macrophage markers. Reflecting their reduced differentiation in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), Trim21&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs had decreased expression of M-CSF signature genes. Although Trim21&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs responded normally to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation, they produced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to the TLR2 agonist PAM3CSK4. In line with this, the response to infection with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin strain of Mycobacterium bovis was also diminished in Trim21&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDMs. Our results indicate that TRIM21 controls responses to TLR2 agonists.</span>

While previously described in Western countries, DDX41 variants have not been reported in a Southeast Asian population. We performed targeted sequencing of blood or bone marrow samples from 109 Thai patients with myeloid malignancies. Among the 109 patients (75 MDS, 8 MPN, 11 MDS/MPN and 15 AML), the most frequent mutations were in ASXL1 (17.4%), TET2 (16.5%) and SRSF2 (12.8%), respectively. DDX41 variants were detectable in six (5.5%) cases. Four patients exhibited three presumable germline DDX41 mutations: p.S21fs (n = 2), p.F235fs (n = 1), and p.R339H (n = 1). While p.S21fs was previously reported in myeloid neoplasm, the latter two variants have not been described. Two of these cases harbored concomitant probable germline/somatic DDX41 mutations (p.S21fs/p.R525H and p.R339H/p.K494T), while the other two patients carried only somatic mutations (p.R525H and p.F438L). The p.K494T and p.F438L variants have not been previously reported. In patients with DDX41 alterations, the diagnoses were MDS with excess blasts (4), secondary AML (1) and low-risk MDS (1).

The molecular pathogenesis of SBDSV infection, nature and dynamics of host immune responses against SBDSV infection remained elusive. In this study, we systematically explored the relative mRNA expression profiles of major innate immune-related genes in SBDSV infected duck embryo fibroblasts. We found that SBDSV infection effectively activated host innate immune responses and resulted in significant up-regulation of IFN-β and several vital IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These up-regulation responses were mainly attributed to viral genomic DNA and dsRNA replication intermediates. Importantly, the expression of cGAS was significantly induced, whereas the expression of other DNA receptors including DDX41, STING, ZBP1, LSM14A and LRRFIP1 have no significant change. Furthermore, SBDSV infection also activates the up-regulation of TLR3 and inhibited the expression of TLR2 and TLR4; however, no effect was observed on the expression of TLR1, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15 and TLR21. Intriguingly, SBDSV infection significantly up-regulated the expression of RNA sensors such as MDA5 and LGP2, and resulted in a delayed but significant up-regulation of RIG-I gene. Taken together, these data indicate that host multiple sensors including DNA sensor (cGAS) and RNA sensors (TLR3, MDA5 and LGP2) are involved in recognizing a variety of different pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral genomic ssDNA and dsRNA replication intermediates, which trigger an effective antiviral innate immune response.</span>

Here we show that viroporin activity of influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B protein triggers translocation of mtDNA into the cytosol in a MAVS-dependent manner. Although influenza virus-induced cytosolic mtDNA stimulates cGAS- and DDX41-dependent innate immune responses, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus associates with mtDNA to evade the STING-dependent antiviral immunity. The STING-dependent antiviral signaling is amplified in neighboring cells through gap junctions. In addition, we find that STING-dependent recognition of influenza virus is essential for limiting virus replication in vivo. Our results show a mechanism by which influenza virus stimulates mtDNA release and highlight the importance of DNA sensing pathway in limiting influenza virus replication.</span>

However, the function of DDX41 remains poorly understood in invertebrates. In a previous study, we identified the first DDX41 sensor in the black tiger shrimp &lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41) and showed that it played a role in anti-viral response. In the present study, we demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;PmDDX41&lt;/i&gt; was localized in the cytoplasm of shrimp hemocytes. However, &lt;i&gt;PmDDX41&lt;/i&gt; was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of hemocytes in the presence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection or when stimulated by the nucleic acid mimics, poly(dA:dT) and poly(I:C). Similar results were observed when &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Immunoprecipitation further demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 bound to biotin-labeled poly(dA:dT) but not poly(I:C). The overexpression of shrimp &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 and mouse stimulator of interferon gene (&lt;i&gt;Mm&lt;/i&gt;STING) in HEK293T cells synergistically promoted IFN-β and NF-κB promoter activity via the DEADc domain. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) also confirmed that there was an interaction between &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 and STING after stimulation with poly(dA:dT) but not poly(I:C). Our study is the first to demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor that interacts with STING via its DEADc domain to trigger the IFN-β and NF-κB signaling pathways, thus activating antiviral innate immune responses.</span>

We analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of DDX41-related myeloid malignancies in an unselected cohort of 1385 patients with MDS or AML. Using targeted next-generation sequencing, we identified 28 different germline DDX41 variants in 43 unrelated patients, which we classified as causal (n = 21) or unknown significance (n = 7) variants. We focused on the 33 patients having causal variants, representing 2.4% of our cohort. The median age was 69 years; most patients were men (79%). Only 9 patients (27%) had a family history of hematological malignancy, and 15 (46%) had a personal history of cytopenia years before MDS/AML diagnosis. Most patients had a normal karyotype (85%), and the most frequent somatic alteration was a second DDX41 mutation (79%). High-risk DDX41 MDS/AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (n = 9) or azacitidine (n = 11) had an overall response rate of 100% or 73%, respectively, with a median overall survival of 5.2 years. Our study highlights that germline DDX41 mutations are relatively common in adult MDS/AML, often without known family history, arguing for systematic screening. Salient features of DDX41-related myeloid malignancies include male preponderance, frequent preexisting cytopenia, additional somatic DDX41 mutation, and relatively good outcome.</span>

HSV-1 employs many sophisticated strategies to escape host antiviral immune response based on its multiple coding proteins. However, the functions involved in the immune evasion of miRNAs encoded by HSV-1 during lytic (productive) infection remain poorly studied. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and bioinformatics revealed that Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box helicase 41 (DDX41), a cytosolic DNA sensor of the DNA-sensing pathway, was a putative direct target gene of HSV-1-encoded miR-H2-3p. The transfection of miR-H2-3p mimics inhibited the expression of DDX41 at the level of mRNA and protein, as well as the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and myxoma resistance protein I (MxI) induced by HSV-1 infection in THP-1 cells, and promoted the viral replication and its gene transcription. However, the transfection of miR-H2-3p inhibitor showed opposite effects. This finding indicated that HSV-1-encoded miR-H2-3p attenuated cytosolic DNA-stimulated antiviral immune response by manipulating host DNA sensor molecular DDX41 to enhance virus replication in cultured cells.</span>

The concurrence of del(5q) and -7/del(7q) accounts for poor prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Comprehensive analysis of copy number abnormalities and genetic mutations related to del(5q) and -7/del(7q) revealed previously cryptic pathophysiology, leading to frequent hemizygous/homozygous mutations and haploinsufficiency. In addition, detailed somatic mutations on chr5q were detected using whole-exome sequencing. CSNK1A1 and G3BP1 are located within the common deleted regions (CDRs) (5q31.1-5q33.1), and another driver gene DDX41 is present in the more telomeric region (5q35.3). All the genes mentioned above exhibited haploinsufficiency because of deletions, and low expression of G3BP1 and DDX41 correlated with poor survival. The related mutational events outside of chr5q, TP53 mutation is most frequently observed in del(5q) cases. Regarding -7/del(7q), 3 CDRs were located in 7q22, 7q34, and 7q35-36. Somatic mutations of the corresponding genes to each CDR (CUX1: 7q22, LUC7L2: 7q34, EZH2: 7q35-36) were identified, indicating that the loss of function or haploinsufficiency might result in the downstream pathological consequences. These recent findings have remarkably offered insights into genetic and clinical consequences in MDS/AML cases with del(5q) and -7/del(7q).</span>

The Workshop Panel reviewed 51 cases with germline mutations and rendered consensus diagnoses. Of these, six cases were presented at the meeting by the submitting pathologists. The cases submitted to the session covering germline predisposition included 16 cases with germline GATA2 mutations, 10 cases with germline RUNX1 mutations, two cases with germline CEBPA mutations, two germline TP53 mutations, and one case of germline DDX41 mutation. The most common diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (15 cases) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 14 cases). The majority of the submitted neoplasms occurring in patients with germline predisposition were myeloid neoplasms with germline mutations in GATA2 and RUNX1. The presence of a germline predisposition mutation is not sufficient for a diagnosis of a neoplasm until the appearance of standard diagnostic features of a hematolymphoid malignancy manifest: in general, the diagnostic criteria for neoplasms associated with germline predisposition disorders are the same as those for sporadic cases.</span>

Recent progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed us to discover frequent mutations throughout the coding regions of MDS, MDS/MPN, and sAML, subsequently providing information on more than 60 driver genes in these diseases. As shown by many study groups recently, such driver mutations are acquired in a gene-specific fashion. DDX41 and SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations are observed in germline cells long before MDS presentation. In blood samples from healthy elderly individuals, somatic DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations are detected as age-related clonal hematopoiesis and supposed to be a risk factor for hematological neoplasms. Recent reports on MDS have shown that mutations in genes such as NRAS and FLT3, designated as Type I genes, were significantly associated with leukemic evolution. Another type (Type II) of genes, including RUNX1 and GATA2, has been shown to be related to the progression from low-risk to high-risk MDS. These driver mutations are significantly concomitant during disease progression. Overall, various types of driver mutations are sequentially acquired in MDS, accounting for the heterogeneity of these disorders.</span>

Inherited cases, however, do occur. Genetic predispositions to myeloid malignancies can be classified into three categories: familial cancer syndromes associated with increased risk of various malignancies including myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD); germline mutations conferring a specific increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia such as mutations in ANKRD26, CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, RUNX1, SRP72 genes; and finally primarily pediatric inherited bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, severe congenital neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and Diamond Blackfan anemia. The recognition of these germline syndromes is essential in the management and follow-up of patients. Herein, we review the conditions associated with hereditary myeloid leukemia with a special clinical focus on management and monitoring.</span>

Genetic defects play a major role in pathogenesis of MDS, including cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations, and abnormal gene expression. Chromosomal abnormalities have been detected in approximately 50-60% of MDS patients, including the deletions of chromosome 5q and 7q, trisomy 8, and complex karyotypes. Newer genomic technologies, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism array and next-generation sequencing, revealed the heterozygous deletions resulting in haploinsufficient gene expression (e.g., CSNK1A1, DDX41 on chromosome 5, CUX1, LUC7L2, EZH2 on chromosome 7) involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. In addition, recurrent somatic mutations in more than 50 genes have been identified in 80-90% of MDS. The most recurrent genetic mutations are involved in the RNA splicing (e.g., SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, LUC7L2, DDX41) and epigenetic modifications, such as histone modification (e.g., ASXL1, EZH2) and DNA methylation (e.g., TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/IDH2). TP53 mutation is associated with aggressive disease and frequently coincides with deletion of chromosome 5q. This review summarizes the recent progress in molecular pathogenesis of MDS. A better understanding of the specific subgroups of MDS patients will also aid in the development of new therapeutic approach for MDS.</span>

However, the precise function of DDX41 in fish during a viral infection remains unknown. In the present study, the DDX41 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcDDX41), was cloned and its potential role in the immune response to a fish viral infection were investigated. EcDDX41 encodes a putative protein of 614 amino acid residues that contained two conserved domains: 1) DEADc domain; and 2) HELICc domain. The sequence analysis indicated that EcDDX41 shared 99%, 94%, and 86% identity with Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and humans (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcDDX41 mRNA was present in all of the detected tissues, with the highest level of expression in the gills. The level of EcDDX41 expression was up-regulated following infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) in grouper spleen (GS) cell cultures, suggesting that EcDDX41 may be involved in fish virus infection. Furthermore, EcDDX41 overexpression in GS cells significantly inhibited SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcDDX41 overexpression significantly increased the expression of antiviral and inflammatory cytokine genes, including interferon regulatory factor genes (e.g., IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, and IRF7), interferon induced genes (e.g., ISG15, ISG56, IFP35, Viperin, and MXI), and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8). Moreover, EcDDX41 positively regulated the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-induced interferon immune response, but did mediate IRF3 activation (MITA) to evoke an interferon immune response in unstimulated cells. Together, our results provide novel insight into the role of fish DDX41 in the antiviral innate immune response.</span>

Limited studies describing the clinicopathologic features and mutation profile are available. We searched for myeloid neoplasms with a DDX41 gene mutation tested by an 81-gene next-generation sequencing panel over a 7-month period. We identified 34 patients with myeloid neoplasms with DDX41 abnormalities; 26 (76%) men and 8 women (24%) [median age, 70 years], 20 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and 3 myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Fifty-nine DDX41 variants were detected: 27 (46%) appeared somatic and 32 (54%) were presumably germline mutations. The majority of presumed germline mutations were upstream of the Helicase 2 domain (93%) and involved loss of the start codon (30%). The majority of somatic mutations were within the Helicase 2 domain (78%), with the missense mutation p.R525H being most common (67%). There was a significant difference in the location of germline or somatic mutations (P &amp;lt; .0001). Concomitant mutations were detected involving 19 genes, but only TP53 (n = 11, 32%), ASXL1 (n = 8, 24%), and JAK2 (n = 4, 12%) were recurrent. Twenty (59%) patients showed diploid cytogenetics. Twenty-three (68%) patients presented with AML or MDS-EB-2, suggesting an association with high-grade myeloid neoplasm. Patients with myeloid neoplasms carrying DDX41 mutations show male predominance (3:1), higher age at presentation, association with TP53 mutations, and association with high-grade myeloid neoplasms in our cohort at a referral cancer center setting. These findings support the recognition of myeloid neoplasms with DDX41 mutation as unique, need for germline confirmation, and further assessment of family members.</span>

We compared genomic features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases with non-AEL myeloid disorders and defined five age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53 mutated; NPM1 mutated; KMT2A mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41 mutated; and pediatric, NUP98 rearranged. Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk leukemia.</span>

There needs to be a greater appreciation of germline predisposition driving the development of hematologic malignancies within the field of myeloid malignancies. Characterization of the influence of germline mutations on the development of myeloid malignancies is ongoing by utilization of next generation sequencing data and prognostic panels. Here, we propose modifications to the utilization and analysis of genetic results, specifically to have a high index of clinical suspicion for germline predisposition, to use assays that are comprehensive for detection of these variants, and a few caveats to interpreting sequencing data. Presented are the benefits and shortcomings of prognostic panels and clinical examples of the utilization of the prognostic panel used within the Department of Pathology at The University of Chicago. The examples demonstrate that panels performed for prognostication on DNA derived from malignant cells are able to identify patients with germline syndromes, but they can lack coverage for genes that confer inherited susceptibility. Furthermore, the panels are often not designed to find duplication and deletion mutations, which calls for a need to improve assay design and bioinformatic approaches to interpret such variants using these data.</span>

In recent years, growing evidence has shown that bacterial extracellular c-di-GMP can interact with the innate immune system and regulate host immune responses. This review summarizes our current understanding on the dual roles of bacterial c-di-GMP in pathogen-host interaction: activation of the antibacterial innate immune response through the cytosolic surveillance pathway and inhibition of innate immune defense for iron restriction.</span>

We report for the first time compound heterozygote germline missense DDX41 mutations located in the DEAD-box domain, identified in two siblings by exome sequencing. Both siblings have slight dysmorphic findings, psychomotor delays and intellectual disability, and one developed blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) at age five. RNA-sequencing of bone marrow showed DDX41 expression including both mutations. However, the allele fraction of p.Pro321Leu accounted for 96% in the RNA-sequencing indicating this mutation to be the more significant variant. Exome sequencing of the leukemic blasts identified no additional known driver mutations. There is no pattern indicating autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition in the family, but the father has sarcoidosis, which has been associated with heterozygous DDX41 mutation. We propose that bi-allelic mutations in DDX41 could potentially be a new cancer predisposition syndrome associated with delayed psychomotor development.</span>

However, the function of avian DDX41 in innate immune response is still unknown. In this study, the full-length duck DDX41 (duDDX41) cDNA sequence was cloned for the first time and encoded a putative protein of 618 amino acid residues which showed the high sequence similarity with both zebra finch and chicken DDX41s. The duDDX41 mRNA was widely distributed in all tested tissues, especially the cerebrum, cerebellum, and liver. Overexpression of duDDX41 triggered the activation of transcription factors IRF1 and NF-κB, as well as IFN-β expression in DEFs. The DEADc domain of duDDX41 played an extremely vital role in duck type I IFN signaling pathway. Knockdown of duDDX41 by siRNA silencing dramatically decreased IFN-β expression stimulated by poly(dA:dT) or duck enteritis virus (DEV). In addition, the replication of DEV was significantly inhibited in duDDX41-expressed DEFs and was enhanced in DDX41 knockdown DEFs. These results suggest that DDX41 is an important cytosolic DNA sensor and plays a crucial role in duck antiviral innate immune response.</span>

However, its occurrence and functions in other vertebrates remain poorly defined. Here, a DDX41 ortholog [&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt; DDX41 (&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41)] with various conserved structural features to its mammalian counterparts was identified from a zebrafish model. This &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 was found to be a trafficking protein distributed in the nucleus of resting cells but transported into the cytoplasm under DNA stimulation. Two nuclear localization signal motifs were localized beside the coiled-coil domain, whereas one nuclear export signal motif existed in the DEADc domain. &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 acts as an initiator for the activation of NF-κB and IFN signaling pathways in a &lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt; STING (&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;STING)-dependent manner through its DEADc domain, which is a typical performance of mammalian DDX41. These observations suggested the conservation of DDX41 proteins throughout the vertebrate evolution, making zebrafish an alternative model in understanding DDX41-mediated immunology. With this model system, we found that &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 contributes to &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;STING-&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt; STAT6 (&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;STAT6)-mediated chemokine (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt; CCL20) production through its DEADc domain. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report showing that DDX41 is an upstream initiator in this newly identified signaling pathway. The &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41-mediated signaling pathways play important roles in innate antibacterial immunity because knockdown of either &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;DDX41 or &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;STING/&lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt;STAT6 significantly reduced the survival of zebrafish under &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas hydrophilia&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella tarda&lt;/i&gt; infection. Our findings would enrich the current knowledge of DDX41-mediated immunology and the evolutionary history of the DDX41 family.</span>

In human cancers, however, the association between DNA damage and an immunogenic cell death (ICD), including the release and sensing of danger signals, the subsequent ER stress response and a functional IFN system, is less clear. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Neoadjuvant-treated colorectal liver metastases (CLM) patients, undergoing liver resection in with a curative intent, were retrospectively enrolled in this study (n=33). DNA damage (γH2AX), RNA and DNA sensors (RIG-I, DDX41, cGAS, STING), ER stress response (p-PKR, p-eIF2α, CALR), type I and type II IFN- induced proteins (MxA, GBP1), mature dendritic cells (CD208), and cytotoxic and memory T cells (CD3, CD8, CD45RO) were investigated by an immunohistochemistry whole-slide tissue scanning approach and further correlated with recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), radiographic and pathologic therapy response. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; γH2AX is a negative prognostic marker for RFS (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.69, p=0.023) and OS (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23-2.11, p&amp;lt;0.001). A model comprising of DDX41, STING and p-PKR predicts radiographic therapy response (AUC=0.785, p=0.002). γH2AX predicts prognosis superior to the prognostic value of CD8. CALR positively correlates with GBP1, CD8 and cGAS. A model consisting of γH2AX, p-eIF2α, DDX41, cGAS, CD208 and CD45RO predicts pathological therapy response (AUC=0.944, p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; In contrast to preclinical models, DNA damage inversely correlated with ICD and its associated T cell infiltrate and potentially serves as a therapeutic target in CLM.</span>

Retrovirus reverse transcription creates numerous potential ligands for cytosolic host sensors that recognize foreign nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), RNA/DNA hybrids, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We and others recently showed that the sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41), and members of the Aim2-like receptor (ALR) family participate in the recognition of retroviral reverse transcripts. However, why multiple sensors might be required and their relative importance in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; control of retroviral infection are not known. Here, we show that DDX41 primarily senses the DNA/RNA hybrid generated at the first step of reverse transcription, while cGAS recognizes dsDNA generated at the next step. We also show that both DDX41 and cGAS are needed for the antiretroviral innate immune response to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV in primary mouse macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Using mice with cell type-specific knockout of the &lt;i&gt;Ddx41&lt;/i&gt; gene, we show that DDX41 sensing in DCs but not macrophages was critical for controlling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MLV infection. This suggests that DCs are essential &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; targets for infection, as well as for initiating the antiviral response. Our work demonstrates that the innate immune response to retrovirus infection depends on multiple host nucleic acid sensors that recognize different reverse transcription intermediates.&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/b&gt; Viruses are detected by many different host sensors of nucleic acid, which in turn trigger innate immune responses, such as type I interferon (IFN) production, required to control infection. We show here that at least two sensors are needed to initiate a highly effective innate immune response to retroviruses-DDX41, which preferentially senses the RNA/DNA hybrid generated at the first step of retrovirus replication, and cGAS, which recognizes double-stranded DNA generated at the second step. Importantly, we demonstrate using mice lacking DDX41 or cGAS that both sensors are needed for the full antiviral response needed to control &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MLV infection. These findings underscore the need for multiple host factors to counteract retroviral infection.</span>

Because these panels include genes associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies (HHMs), we hypothesized that these panels could identify pathogenic germ line variants in malignant cells, thereby identifying patients at risk for HHMs. In total, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;ANKRD26&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CEBPA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ETV6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GATA2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; were identified in 74 (21%) of 360 patients. Germ line tissue was available for 24 patients with 25 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants with variant allele frequencies &amp;gt;0.4. Six (24%) of these 25 variants were of germ line origin. Three &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; variants, 2 &lt;i&gt;GATA2&lt;/i&gt; variants, and a &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; variant previously implicated in Li-Fraumeni syndrome were of germ line origin. No likely pathogenic/pathogenic germ line variants possessed variant allele frequencies &amp;lt;0.4. This study demonstrates that NGS-based prognostic panels may identify individuals at risk for HHMs despite not being designed for this purpose. Furthermore, variants known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as known pathogenic variants in genes such as &lt;i&gt;DDX41&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GATA2&lt;/i&gt; are especially likely to be of germ line origin. Thus, tumor-based panels may augment, but should not replace, comprehensive germ line-based testing and counseling.</span>

The purpose of this study was to find the proteome of cultured human fetal lung diploid fibroblasts (2BS) of different population doubling (PD), as well as the altered proteome induced by salidroside (SAL) in 2BS cells. Proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time and flight mass spectrometry (MAL DI-TOF/MS). As a result, we found 16 proteins with two-fold variations in senescent cells or after SAL treatment, some being reduced such as reticulocalbin-1, heat shock protein beta-6, elongation factor 1-delta, F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-1, and chloride intracellular channel 1. In contrast, 40S ribosomal protein SA, proteasome subunit alpha type-5, and zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 5 increased with cell age. Furthermore, heat shock protein beta-6, Zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 5 was increased in PD30 cells after 10 μM SAL treatment, whereas, elongation factor 1-delta, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-1, Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX41, Chloride intracellular channel 1, and Peroxiredoxin-6 were increased in PD50 cells after 10 μM SAL treatment. Some of these proteins were involved in the protein synthetic and degradative pathways, which emphasizes the metabolic disorder or functional impairment of cell senescence. Moreover, these proteins could be candidate biomarkers for evaluating the SAL anti-senescence effect.</span>

Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of PmDDX41, the first cytosolic DNA sensor in shrimp. By searching a Penaeus monodon expressed sequence tag (EST) database (http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th), three cDNA fragments exhibiting similarity to DDX41 in various species were identified and assembled, resulting in a complete open reading frame of PmDDX41 that contains 1863-bp and encodes a putative protein of 620 amino acids. PmDDX41 shares 83% and 79% similarity to DDX41 homolog from the bee Apis florea and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, respectively and contains three conserved domains in the protein: DEADc domain, HELICc domain, and zinc finger domain. The transcript of PmDDX41 was detected in all tested tissues and was up-regulated upon infection with a DNA virus, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). However, PmDDX41 mRNA expression was not significantly changed and down-regulated in response to a bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, or an RNA virus, yellow head virus (YHV), respectively, compared with the control phosphate-buffered saline-injected shrimp. Furthermore, the suppression of PmDDX41 by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing resulted in more rapid death of WSSV-infected shrimp and a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of several immune-related genes (PmIKKβ, PmIKKɛ, PmRelish, PmCactus, PmDorsal, PmPEN3, PmPEN5, and ALFPm6). These results suggest that PmDDX41 is involved in the antiviral response, probably via a DNA-sensing pathway that is triggered through the IκB kinase complex and leads to the activation of several immune-related genes.</span>

As shown by many study groups these days, such driver mutations are acquired in a gene-specific fashion. For instance, DDX41 mutations are observed in germline cells long before MDS presentation. In blood samples from healthy elderly individuals, somatic DNMT3A and TET2 mutations are detected as age-related clonal hematopoiesis and are believed to be a risk factor for hematological neoplasms. In MDS, mutations of genes such as NRAS and FLT3, designated as Type-1 genes, may be significantly associated with leukemic evolution. Another type (Type-2) of genes, including RUNX1 and GATA2, are related to progression from low-risk to high-risk MDS. Overall, various driver mutations are sequentially acquired in MDS, at a specific time, in either germline cells, normal hematopoietic cells, or clonal MDS cells.</span>

Here, we report the identification of the first avian DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 41 (DDX41), an important DNA sensor, in chicken cells. In our study, we confirmed that chDDX41 is not an interferon-inducible gene. Knockdown of chDDX41 expression by shRNA blocked the ability of DF-1 cells to mount an IFN-β response to DNA and associated viruses. ChDDX41 mRNAs could be upregulated by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) analogue poly(dA:dT), but not by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogue poly(I:C). In poly(dA:dT) stimulation assays, the immune molecules involved in the DDX41-mediated IFN-β pathway in human cells were universally upregulated in chicken cells. Via coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments, we found that chDDX41 could strongly interact with chicken stimulator of IFN genes (chSTING). Therefore, our results suggest that chDDX41 is involved in the dsDNA- and dsDNA virus-mediated chDDX41-chSTING-IFN-β signaling pathway in chicken cells.</span>

Germline mutations in DDX41 gene have been discovered in several leukemia families, as well as in mostly adult patients with seemingly spontaneous disease but having strong family histories of myeloid neoplasia. As with other familial genes, DDX41 mutation carriers can develop neoplasia through acquisition of another somatic mutation, thereby affecting both DDX41 alleles. In other patients, somatic mutations of different driver genes can substitute for acquired missense DDX41 during progression. Conversely, non-familial cases with heterozygous somatic DDX41 mutations point towards other mutations that can substitute for the germ line founder DDX41 lesions. In either circumstance, total inactivation of DDX41 appears to be cell-lethal, explaining why frameshift germline lesions have not been found to be accompanied by deletions of the DDX41 locus on 5q. The precise function of the DDX41 protein is unknown; considerable evidence suggests its involvement in RNA splicing. Thus DDX41 can be included in the now large group of mutated spliceosomal genes affected in myeloid neoplasia. However, it appears that DDX4 is so far the only example of a germline spliceosomal mutation in leukemia. Clinically, recognition of DDX41 mutated cases may have implications for surveillance, assessment of prognosis, and, perhaps, for design of targeted therapies.</span>

The activation of STING signaling leads to the production of type I interferons and some other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are critical for host defense against viral infection. Recent accumulating evidences suggest that STING is also involved in tumor development. However, the role of STING signaling in tumorigenesis is complicated, and a comprehensive review is still lacking. In this paper, we provided an overview of the dual role of STING signaling in tumor development from clinical significance to fundamental mechanisms, as well as its pre-clinical application in cancer therapy.</span>

The majority of germline mutations are frameshift mutations suggesting loss of function with DDX41 acting as a tumor suppressor, and there is a common somatic missense mutation found in a majority of germline mutated tumors. Clinically, DDX41 mutations lead to development of high-risk MDS at an age similar to that observed in sporadic cohorts, presenting a unique challenge to hematologists in recognizing the familial context. Functionally, DDX41 has been shown to contribute to multiple pathways and processes including mRNA splicing, innate immunity and rRNA processing. Mutations in DDX41 result in aberrations to each of these in ways that could potentially impact on tumorigenesis-initiation, maintenance or progression. This review discusses the various molecular, clinical and biological aspects of myeloid malignancy predisposition due to DDX41 mutation and highlights how each of these suggest potential therapeutic opportunities through the use of pathway-specific inhibitors.</span>

DDX41 is affected by somatic mutations in sporadic cases of myeloid neoplasms as well as in a biallelic fashion in 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations. The R525H mutation in DDX41 is thought to play important roles in the development of hereditary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelocytic leukemia. In this study, human DDX41 and its R525H mutant (R525H) were expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and purified. The ATPase activities of the recombinant DDX41 and R525H proteins were dependent on both ATP and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), such as poly(dG-dC) and poly(dA-dT). High-throughput screening was performed with a dsDNA-dependent ATPase assay using the human R525H proteins. After hit confirmation and counterscreening, several small-molecule inhibitors were successfully identified. These compounds show DDX41-selective inhibitory activities.</span>

In the last ten years, next generation sequencing based studies identified novel germline mutations in the background of familial aggregation of certain haematologic disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is supported by the fact that the myeloid neoplasms with genetic predisposition represent a new category in the revised 2016 World Health Organization classification. According to the new classification, these disorders are subdivided based on the clinical and genetic features, including myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition alone, or with pre-existing platelet disorder, cytopaenias or other organ failures. The predisposing genetic factors include mutations in the RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, ETV6, DDX41, TERC or TERT and SRP72 genes. The genes affected in these syndromes are important regulators of haemopoiesis and are frequently implicated in leukaemogenesis, providing deeper insight into the understanding of normal and malignant haemopoiesis. Despite the growing knowledge of germline predisposing events in the background of familial myeloid malignancies, the germline genetic component is still unknown in a subset of these pedigrees. Here, we present the first study of inherited myeloid malignancies in Hungary. We identified three families with apparent clustering of myeloid malignancies with nine affected individuals across these pedigrees. All tested individuals were negative for CEBPA, GATA2, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6, DDX41, TERC or TERT and SRP72 mutations, suggesting the presence of so far unidentified predisposing mutations.</span>

Thus, expression of p21 has to be tightly controlled, which is achieved by numerous mechanisms at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational level. Performing immunoprecipitation of bromouridine-labeled p21 mRNAs that had been incubated before with cytoplasmic extracts of untreated HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, we identified the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX41 as a novel regulator of p21 expression. DDX41 specifically precipitates with the 3'UTR, but not with the 5'UTR, of p21 mRNA. Knockdown of DDX41 increases basal and γ irradiation-induced p21 protein levels without affecting p21 mRNA expression. Conversely, overexpression of DDX41 strongly inhibits expression of a FLAG-p21 and a luciferase construct, but only in the presence of the p21 3'UTR. Together, these data suggest that this helicase regulates p21 expression at the translational level independent of the transcriptional activity of p53. However, knockdown of DDX41 completely fails to increase p21 protein levels in p53-deficient HCT116 cells. Moreover, posttranslational up-regulation of p21 achieved in both p53&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and p53&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; HCT116 cells in response to pharmaceutical inhibition of the proteasome (by MG-132) or p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (by BI-D1870) is further increased by knockdown of DDX41 only in p53-proficient but not in p53-deficient cells. Although our data demonstrate that DDX41 suppresses p21 translation without disturbing the function of p53 to directly induce p21 mRNA expression, this process indirectly requires p53, perhaps in the form of another p53 target gene or as a still undefined posttranscriptional function of p53.</span>

These cytokines are detrimental to the host during infection by priming leukocytes to undergo &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;-mediated apoptosis. Our previous studies showed that C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and C3aR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice are highly susceptible to &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; infection as a result of increased IFN-β-mediated apoptosis of major leukocyte cell populations, including CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. However, the mechanisms by which C3a and C5a modulate IFN-β expression during &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; infection were not examined in these initial investigations. Accordingly, we report in this article that C5a and C3a suppress IFN-β production in response to &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; via cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), a secondary messenger molecule of &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, in J774A.1 macrophage-like cells and in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Moreover, C5a and C3a suppress IFN-β production by acting through their respective receptors, because no inhibition was seen in C5aR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; or C3aR&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; BMDCs, respectively. C5a and C3a suppress IFN-β production in a manner that is dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase, p38 MAPK, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), as demonstrated by the individual use of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, p38 MAPK, and TBK1 inhibitors. Pretreatment of cells with C5a and C3a reduced the expression of the IFN-β signaling molecules DDX41, STING, phosphorylated TBK1, and phosphorylated p38 MAPK in wild-type BMDCs following treatment with c-di-AMP. Collectively, these data demonstrate that C3a and C5a, via direct signaling through their specific receptors, suppress IFN-β expression by modulation of a distinct innate cytosolic surveillance pathway involving DDX41, STING, and other downstream molecular targets of &lt;i&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;-generated c-di-AMP.</span>

Glycoprotein (G)-based DNA vaccines had been proven to be effective in combating infection against Rhabdovirus (especially infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, IHNV) in salmonids. DDX41 is a helicase known to induce antiviral and inflammatory responses by inducing a type I IFN innate immune response. To gain more information regarding G-based DNA vaccines in olive flounder (Paralicthys olivaceus), we tried to develop a more efficient G-based DNA vaccine by adding a molecular adjuvant, DDX41. We designed a DNA vaccine in which the VHSV glycoprotein (G-protein) and DDX41 were driven by the EF-1α and CMV promoters, respectively. Olive flounders were intramuscularly immunized with 1 μg of plasmids encoding the G-based DNA vaccine alone (pEF-G), the molecular adjuvant alone (pEF-D), or the vaccine-adjuvant construct (pEF-GD). At two different time points, 15 and 30 days later, the fish were intraperitoneally infected with VHSV (100 μL; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/mL). Our assays revealed that the plasmid constructs showed up-regulated expression of IFN-1 and its associated genes at day 3 post-vaccination in both kidney and spleen samples. Specifically, pEF-GD showed statistically higher expression of immune response genes than pEF-G and pEF-D treated group (p &amp;lt; 0.05/p &amp;lt; 0.001). After VHSV challenge, the fish group treated with pEF-GD showed higher survival rate than the pEF-G treated group, though difference was not statistically significant in the 15 dpv challenged group however in the 30 dpv challenged group, the difference was statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that DDX41 is an effective adjuvant for the G-based DNA vaccine in olive flounder.

To define the pathogenic molecular features associated with del(5q), next-generation sequencing was applied to 133 patients with myeloid neoplasms (MDS; N = 69, MDS/MPN; N = 5, sAML; N = 29, pAML; N = 30) with del(5q) as a sole abnormally or a part of complex karyotype and results were compared to molecular features of patients diploid for chr5. A number of 5q genes with haploinsufficient expression and/or recurrent somatic mutations were identified; for these genes, CSNK1A1 and G3BP1 within the commonly deleted 5q region and DDX41 within a commonly retained region were most commonly affected by somatic mutations. These genes showed consistent haploinsufficiency in deleted cases; low expression/mutations of G3BP1 or DDX41 were associated with poor survival, likely due to decreased cellular function. The most common mutations on other chromosomes in patients with del(5q) included TP53, and mutations of FLT3 (ITD or TKD), NPM1 or TET2 and were mutually exclusive. Serial sequencing allowed for definition of clonal architecture and dynamics, in patients with exome sequencing allelic imbalance for informative SNPs facilitated simultaneous approximation of clonal size of del(5q) and clonal burden for somatic mutations.

Recent work has better defined the leukemia risk and outcomes in these syndromes. Also, in the last several years, a number of other germ line mutations have been discovered to define new leukemia predisposition syndromes, including ANKRD26, GATA2, PAX5, ETV6, and DDX41 In addition, data suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with therapy related leukemias harbor germ line mutations in DNA damage response genes such as BRCA1/2 and TP53 Recognition of clinical associations, acquisition of a thorough family history, and high index-of-suspicion are critical in the diagnosis of these leukemia predisposition syndromes. Accurate identification of patients with germ line mutations associated with leukemia can have important clinical implications as it relates to management of the leukemia, as well as genetic counseling of family members.</span>

However, it is assumed that genetic predispositions to HM are currently underestimated due to great variations in disease phenotype, variable latency and incomplete penetrance. Most of patients do not display any biological or clinical signs besides the overt hematological disease and many of them have a lack of personal or family history of malignancies. Areas covered: Collaborative studies and important advances in molecular testing have led to the discovery of several genes recurrently deregulated in familial HM including RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, SRP72, PAX5, DDX41, ETV6, ATG2B/GSKIP and TERT/TERC. This review summarizes biological and clinical findings encountered within these disorders. Expert commentary: Identify and manage individuals with genetic predisposition is a current challenge for hematologists. Their identification has immediate implications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation including donor selection and conditioning regimen. Importantly, several features, including familial and personal history as well as molecular and cytogenetic findings, may help clinicians to suspect an underlying genetic predisposition.</span>

DEAD box protein 41 (DDX41) is an intracellular PRR that triggers the downstream pathway involving the adapter STING, the kinase TBK1, and the transcription factor IRF3, to activate the type I interferon response. DDX41 is unique in that it recognizes two different ligands; i.e., double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and cyclic dinucleotides (CDN), via its DEAD domain. However, the structural basis for the ligand recognition by the DDX41 DEAD domain has remained elusive. Here, we report two crystal structures of the DDX41 DEAD domain in apo forms, at 1.5 and 2.2 Å resolutions. A comparison of the two crystal structures revealed the flexibility in the ATP binding site, suggesting its formation upon ATP binding. Structure-guided functional analyses in vitro and in vivo demonstrated the overlapped binding surface for dsDNA and CDN, which is distinct from the ATP-binding site. We propose that the structural rearrangement of the ATP binding site is crucial for the release of ADP, enabling the fast turnover of DDX41 for the dsDNA/CDN-induced STING activation pathway.</span>

DExD/H-box helicases comprise the largest SF2 helicase superfamily, which are characterized by two conserved RecA-like domains. In recent years, an increasing number of unexpected functions of these proteins have been discovered. They play important roles not only in innate immune response but also in diseases like cancers and chronic hepatitis C. In this review, we summarize the recent literatures on one member of the SF2 superfamily, the DEAD-box protein DDX41. After bacterial or viral infection, DNA or cyclic-di-GMP is released to cells. After phosphorylation of Tyr414 by BTK kinase, DDX41 will act as a sensor to recognize the invaders, followed by induction of type I interferons (IFN). After the immune response, DDX41 is degraded by the E3 ligase TRIM21, using Lys9 and Lys115 of DDX41 as the ubiquitination sites. Besides the roles in innate immunity, DDX41 is also related to diseases. An increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in DDX41 gene are identified from myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) patients. The review focuses on DDX41, as well as its homolog Abstrakt in Drosophila, which is important for survival at all stages throughout the life cycle of the fly.</span>

For example, children with Down syndrome are predisposed to developing acute myeloid leukemia, and those with RASopathies, such as Noonan syndrome, are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. To date, more than 250 diseases or syndromes have been reported to be associated with the development of pediatric cancers. Recently, the advent of the massive parallel sequencing technique revealed several germline mutations, including RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, SRP72, ETV6, and DDX41, which are associated with familial myeloid malignancies. A significant number of children with myeloid malignancies may harbor pathognomonic germline variants. It is strongly recommended that precise diagnosis, genetic counseling, familial screening, and follow-up programs be provided for patients with such a predisposition to cancer. To identify genetic disorders associated with predispositions to pediatric myeloid malignancies, the development of an efficient screening system with the massive parallel sequencer for germline and somatic mutations, which would also be useful for familial genetic studies and prediction of tumor progression, is needed.</span>

Especially, single nucleotide polymorphism array karyotyping and next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have unveiled frequent genetic changes in novel functional pathways, including DNA methylation, RNA splicing and cohesin complex formation, in MDS. Moreover, NGS shed light on the clonal evolution which occurs during the development and progression of MDS, pre-cancerous lesions of MDS, and the effects of germline mutations in MDS.</span>

Familial forms of MDS have traditionally been considered rare, especially in adults; however, the increasing availability of somatic and germline genetic analyses has identified multiple susceptibility loci. Bone marrow failure syndromes have been well-described in the pediatric setting, e.g., Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SBS), hallmarked by clinically-recognizable phenotypes (e.g., radial ray anomalies in FA) and significantly increased risks for MDS and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the setting of bone marrow failure. However, additional families with multiple cases of MDS or AML have long been reported in the medical literature with little known regarding potential hereditary etiologies. Over the last decade, genomic investigation of such families has revealed multiple genes conferring inherited risks for MDS and/or AML as the primary malignancy, including RUNX1, ANKRD26, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, and SRP72. As these syndromes are increasingly appreciated in even apparently de novo presentations of MDS, it is important for hematologists/oncologists to become familiar with these newly-described syndromes. Herein, we provide a review of familial MDS syndromes and practical aspects of management in patients with predisposition syndromes. </span>

Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported. From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients ≤ 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy. Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS, respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance. In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was confirmed in 12 patients (18%). HCS identification provides insight for improved and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for family members. The HHMC has facilitated HCS diagnosis; with increased clinical awareness of hematologic malignancy predisposition syndromes, more patients who may benefit from evaluation can be identified. Mutation panels intended for prognostication may provide increased clinical suspicion for germ-line testing.</span>

The acquired mutation in DDX41 is highly concentrated at c.G1574A (p.R525H) in the conserved motif VI located at the C-terminus of the helicase core domain where ATP interacts and is hydrolyzed. Therefore, it is likely that the p.R525H mutation perturbs ATPase activity in a dominant-negative manner. In this study, we screened for the DDX41 mutation of CD34-positive tumor cells based on mRNA sequencing and identified the p.R525H mutation in three cases among 23 patients. Intriguingly, these patients commonly exhibited acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with peripheral blood cytopenias and low blast counts, suggesting that the mutation inhibits the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Data from cord blood cells and leukemia cell lines suggest a role for DDX41 in preribosomal RNA processing, in which the expression of the p.R525H mutant causes a certain ribosomopathy phenotype in hematopoietic cells by suppressing MDM2-mediated RB degradation, thus triggering the inhibition of E2F activity. This study uncovered a pathogenic role of p.R525H DDX41 in the slow growth rate of tumor cells.

These disorders are considered rare, but are likely to be more common than currently appreciated, and are characterized by the autosomal dominant mutations of hematopoietic transcription factors. These syndromes have typical phenotypic features and are associated with an increased risk for developing overt malignancy. Currently, four recognized syndromes could be separated: familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA, familial myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with mutated GATA2, familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy with RUNX1 mutations, and telomere biology disorders due to mutations of TERC or TERT. Furthermore, there are new, emerging syndromes associated with germline mutations in novel genes including ANKRD26, ETV6, SRP72 or DDX41. This review will discuss the current understanding of the genetic basis and clinical presentation of familial leukemia and myelodysplasia.</span>

To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. We also show that most asymptomatic mutation carriers have normal blood counts until malignancy develops. This study expands both the mutation and phenotypic spectra observed in families with germ line DDX41 mutations. With an increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in this gene being identified, further study of how DDX41 disruption leads to hematologic malignancies is critical. </span>

With the growing availability of clinical genetic testing, there is an increasing appreciation that a number of genetic predisposition syndromes may underlie apparent de novo presentations of MDS/AML, particularly in children and young adults. Recent findings of clonal hematopoiesis in acquired aplastic anemia add another facet to our understanding of the mechanisms of MDS/AML predisposition. As more predisposition syndromes are recognized, it is becoming increasingly important for hematologists and oncologists to have familiarity with the common as well as emerging syndromes, and to have a systematic approach to diagnosis and screening of at risk patient populations. Here, we provide a practical algorithm for approaching a patient with a suspected MDS/AML predisposition, and provide an in-depth review of the established and emerging familial MDS/AML syndromes caused by mutations in the ANKRD26, CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, RUNX1, SRP72 genes. Finally, we discuss recent data on the role of somatic mutations in malignant transformation in acquired aplastic anemia, and review the practical aspects of MDS/AML management in patients and families with predisposition syndromes. </span>

Humans and mice possess cytoplasmic DNA/RNA sensors for detecting viral replication. There are a number of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp; DExD/H) box-type helicases in mammals, among which retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA50) are indispensable for RNA sensing; however, they are functionally supported by a number of sensors that directly bind viral RNA or replicative RNA intermediates to convey signals to RIG-I and MDA5. Some DEAD box helicase members recognize DNA irrespective of the origin. These sensors transmit IFN-inducing signals through adaptors, including mitochondrial antiviral signaling. Viral double-stranded RNAs are reportedly sensed by the helicases DDX1, DDX21, DHX36, DHX9, DDX3, DDX41, LGP2 and DDX60, in addition to RIG-I and MDA5, and induce type I IFNs, thereby blocking viral replication. Humans and mice have all nucleic acid sensors listed here. In the RNA sensing system in chicken, it was found in the present study that most DEAD box helicases are conserved; however, DHX9 is genetically deficient in addition to reported RIG-I. Based on the current genome databases, similar DHX9 deficiency was observed in ducks and several other bird species. Because chicken, but not duck, was found to be deficient in RIG-I, the RNA-sensing system of chicken lacks RIG-I and DHX9 and is thus more fragile than that of duck or mammal. DHX9 may generally compensate for the function of RIG-I and deficiency of DHX9 possibly participates in exacerbations of viral infection such as influenza in chickens. </span>

Here, we describe an adult familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) syndrome caused by germline mutations in the DEAD/H-box helicase gene DDX41. DDX41 was also found to be affected by somatic mutations in sporadic cases of myeloid neoplasms as well as in a biallelic fashion in 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations. Moreover, corresponding deletions on 5q35.3 present in 6% of cases led to haploinsufficient DDX41 expression. DDX41 lesions caused altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing. DDX41 is exemplary of other RNA helicase genes also affected by somatic mutations, suggesting that they constitute a family of tumor suppressor genes. </span>

The mRNA and protein expressions of DDX41 in human dental pulp cells were detected by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, and the expression of DDX41 in human dental pulp tissues was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Strong expressions of DDX41 mRNA and protein were detected in dental pulp cells. In dental pulp tissues, DDX41 was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of odontoblasts. DDX41/STING-dependent TBK1-IRF3-IFN-β signaling pathway may play a role in innate immune responses of the dental pulp to caries and pulpitis.</span>

Here, we show how upstream sensing of retroviral reverse transcripts integrates with the downstream effector APOBEC3, an IFN-induced cytidine deaminase that introduces lethal mutations during retroviral reverse transcription. Using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) variant with an unstable capsid that induces a strong IFNβ antiviral response, we identify three sensors, IFI203, DDX41, and cGAS, required for MLV nucleic acid recognition. These sensors then signal using the adaptor STING, leading to increased production of IFNβ and other targets downstream of the transcription factor IRF3. Using knockout and mutant mice, we show that APOBEC3 limits the levels of reverse transcripts that trigger cytosolic sensing, and that nucleic acid sensing in vivo increases expression of IFN-regulated restriction factors like APOBEC3 that in turn reduce viral load. These studies underscore the importance of the multiple layers of protection afforded by host factors.</span>

Here, the olive flounder DDX41 was found to have 2267-bp long and encodes a putative protein of 614 amino acid residues. The olive flounder DDX41 mRNA was presented in all tested tissues, and was distinctly expressed in fish naturally infected with LCDV. High expression levels were observed in the heart, liver, kidney and stomach. Furthermore, the olive flounder DDX41 mRNA expression increased significantly in adherent (monocyte-like) cells following stimulation with a DNA virus. Reporter assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the IFN-I promoter was enhanced in DDX41-overexpressing HINAE cells treated with C-di-GMP (dinucleotides). Overexpression of DDX41 also induced the antiviral and inflammatory cytokine gene expression through cytoplasmic C-di-GMP treatment. These results suggest that DDX41 functions as a cytosolic DNA sensor that is capable of inducing antiviral activity and inflammatory responses in the olive flounder. </span>

We demonstrate here that BTK-deficient cells have impaired IFN-β production and TBK1/IRF3 activation when stimulated with agonists or infected with pathogens that activate STING signaling. BTK interacts with STING and DDX41 helicase. The kinase and SH3/SH2 interaction domains of BTK bind, respectively, the DEAD-box domain of DDX41 and transmembrane region of STING. BTK phosphorylates DDX41, and its kinase activities are critical for STING-mediated IFN-β production. We show that Tyr364 and Tyr414 of DDX41 are critical for its recognition of AT-rich DNA and binding to STING, and tandem mass spectrometry identifies Tyr414 as the BTK phosphorylation site. Modeling studies further indicate that phospho-Tyr414 strengthens DDX41's interaction with STING. Hence, BTK plays a critical role in the activation of DDX41 helicase and STING signaling. </span>

Members of PRRs sense diverse microbial invasions or danger signals, and initiate innate immune signaling pathways, leading to proinflammatory cytokines production, which, in turn, instructs adaptive immune response development. Despite the diverse functions employed by innate immune signaling to respond to a variety of different pathogens, the innate immune response must be tightly regulated. Otherwise, aberrant, uncontrolled immune responses will lead to harmful, or even fatal, consequences. Therefore, it is essential to better discern innate immune signaling and many regulators, controlling various signaling pathways, have been identified. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in our understanding of the activation and regulation of innate immune signaling in the host response to pathogens and cancer. </span>

It has been well demonstrated that cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays an important role in sensing cytosolic DNA and triggering STING dependent signaling to induce IFN-I. However, it is largely unknown how cGAS itself is regulated during pathogen infection and IFN-I production. In this study, we show that pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, including lipid A, LPS, poly(I:C), poly(dA:dT), and cGAMP, induce cGAS expression in an IFN-I-dependent manner in both mouse and human macrophages. Further experiments indicated that cGAS is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), and two adjacent IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region of cGAS mediate the induction of cGAS by IFN-I. Additionally, we show that optimal production of IFN-β triggered by poly (dA:dT) or HSV-1 requires IFNAR signaling. Knockdown of the constitutively expressed DNA sensor DDX41 attenuates poly(dA:dT)-triggered IFN-β production and cGAS induction. By analyzing the dynamic expression of poly(dA:dT)-induced IFN-β and cGAS transcripts, we have found that induction of IFN-β is earlier than cGAS. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that induction of cGAS by IFN-I meditates the subsequent positive feedback regulation of DNA-triggered IFN-I production. Thus, our study not only provides a novel mechanism of modulating cGAS expression, but also adds another layer of regulation in DNA-triggered IFN-I production by induction of cGAS. </span>

In this study, porcine DDX41 (poDDX41) was cloned and its role in the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway was investigated in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Full-length poDDX41 cDNA encodes 622 amino acid residues and contains a DEADc domain and a HELICc domain. poDDX41 mRNA is widely expressed in different tissues, especially the stomach and liver. Overexpression of poDDX41 in PK-15 cells induced IFN-β by activating transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB. Knockdown of poDDX41 with siRNA significantly reduced IFN-β expression induced by poly(dA:dT), a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) analogue, or pseudorabies virus, a dsDNA swine virus. Therefore, poDDX41 is involved in the dsDNA- and dsDNA-virus-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway in porcine kidney cells.</span>

They function as second messengers and are thought to participate in the signal transduction of cytosolic DNA immune responses. One such dinucleotide, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), stimulates the immune system. It is thought that c-di-GMP is recognized by ATP dependent RNA helicase (DDX41) in the cytosol, forms a complex with the Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), triggers a signal via the tank binding kinase 1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (TBK1-IRF3) pathway and induces the production of type I interferons. Therefore c-di-GMP can be thought of as a new class of adjuvant. However, because c-di-GMP contains two phosphate groups, this prevents its use as an adjuvant because it cannot pass through the cell membrane, even though the target molecule of c-di-GMP is located in the cytoplasm. Our group has been developing a series of liposomal drug delivery systems and recently investigated YSK05 which is a synthetic, pH sensitive lipid that has a high fusogenicity. We utilized this lipid as a carrier to transport c-di-GMP into the cytosol to then use c-di-GMP as an adjuvant. Based on screening experiments, YSK05/POPE/cholesterol=40/25/35 was found to induce IFN-β in Raw264.7 cells. The induction of IFN-β from c-di-GMP liposomes was inhibited by adding BX795, a TBK1 inhibitor, indicating that the production of IFN-β caused the activation of the STING-TBK1 pathway. C-di-GMP liposomes also showed significantly higher levels of expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC class I. The c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposome facilitated antigen specific cytotoxic T cell activity and the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model. These findings indicate that c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposomes could be used, not only to transfer c-di-GMP to the cytosol and induce an innate immune system but also as a platform for investigating the mechanism of immune sensing with cyclic dinucleotides in vitro and in vivo. </span>

The RNA and DNA sensors evoke innate immune responses through the IPS-1 and STING adaptors. IPS-1 and STING activate TBK1 kinase. TBK1 is phosphorylated in its activation loop, leading to IRF3/7 activation and Type I interferon (IFN) production. IPS-1 and STING localize to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, whereas it is unclear where phosphorylated TBK1 is localized in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. Here, we investigated phospho-TBK1 (p-TBK1) subcellular localization using a p-TBK1-specific antibody. Stimulation with vertebrate DNA by transfection increased p-TBK1 levels. Interestingly, stimulation-induced p-TBK1 exhibited mitochondrial localization in HeLa and HepG2 cells and colocalized with mitochondrial IPS-1 and MFN-1. Hepatitis B virus DNA stimulation or herpes simplex virus type-1 infection also induced p-TBK1 mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells, indicating that cytoplasmic viral DNA induces p-TBK1 mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells. In contrast, p-TBK1 did not show mitochondrial localization in RAW264.7, L929, or T-23 cells, and most of p-TBK1 colocalized with STING in response to cytoplasmic DNA in those mammalian cells, indicating cell type-specific localization of p-TBK1 in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. A previous knockout study showed that mouse IPS-1 was dispensable for Type I IFN production in response to cytoplasmic DNA. However, we found that knockdown of IPS-1 markedly reduced p-TBK1 levels in HeLa cells. Taken together, our data elucidated the cell type-specific subcellular localization of p-TBK1 and a cell type-specific role of IPS-1 in TBK1 activation in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. </span>

A variety of DNA sensors (DAI, AIM2, DDx41, RNA polymerase [Pol] III, and IFI16 [p204]) have been identified in recent years; however, the DNA sensor involved in detection of adenovirus has not been established. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a DNA sensor that produces a cyclic guanine-adenine dinucleotide (cGAMP) inducer of STING, has been examined to determine its role in generating an antiadenoviral response. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vectors targeting TBK1, STING, and cGAS were established in murine MS1 endothelial and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. Knockdown of TBK1, STING, and cGAS results in a dramatic reduction in the activation of the primary antiviral response marker phosphorylated interferon (IFN) response factor 3 (IRF3) following exposure to adenovirus. Furthermore, activation of secondary type I IFN signaling targets ((ptyr)STAT1 and (ptyr)STAT2 [(ptyr)STAT1/2]) was also compromised. Consistent with compromised activation of primary and secondary response markers, transcriptional activation of IRF3-responsive genes (beta IFN [IFN-β], ISG15, ISG54) and secondary response transcripts were diminished in cells knocked down in cGAS, STING, or TBK1. These data establish cGAS as the dominant cytosolic DNA sensor responsible for detection of internalized adenovirus leading to induction of the type I interferon antiviral cascade. </span>

Mammalian cells express different classes of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors that monitor the extracellular and intracellular compartments of host cells for signs of infection and that activate several conserved signalling pathways. An efficient immune response often requires the sequential detection of a pathogen by different receptors in different subcellular compartments, which results in a complex interplay of downstream signalling pathways. In this Review, we discuss the recent identification of previously unknown pattern recognition receptors and how they complement the repertoire of established receptors. </span>

On the other hand, it is accepted that DexD/H-box helicases also engage in activities that do not require helicase activity. A number of DExD/H-box helicases have been shown to be involved in anti-viral immunity. The RIG-like helicases, RIG-I, mda5 and lgp2, act as important cytosolic pattern recognition receptors for viral RNA. Detection of viral nucleic acids by the RIG-like helicases or other anti-viral pattern recognition receptors leads to the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. More recently, additional DExD/H-box helicases have also been implicated to act as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids, including DDX3, DDX41, DHX9, DDX60, DDX1 and DHX36. However, there is evidence that at least some of these helicases might have more downstream functions in pattern recognition receptor signalling pathways, as signalling adaptors or transcriptional regulators. In an interesting twist, a lot of DExD/H-box helicases have also been identified as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses, suggesting that viruses 'hijack' their RNA helicase activities for their benefit. Interestingly, DDX3, DDX1 and DHX9 are among the helicases that are required for the replication of a diverse range of viruses. This might suggest that these helicases are highly contested targets in the ongoing 'arms race' between viruses and the host immune system.

We identified the E3 ligase TRIM21 as a DDX41-interacting protein and found that knockdown of or deficiency in TRIM21 resulted in enhanced type I interferon responses to intracellular dsDNA and DNA viruses. Overexpression of TRIM21 resulted in more degradation of DDX41 and less production of interferon-β (IFN-β) in response to intracellular dsDNA. The SPRY-PRY domain of TRIM21 interacted with the DEADc domain of DDX41. Lys9 and Lys115 of DDX41 were the targets of TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination. TRIM21 is therefore an interferon-inducible E3 ligase that induces the Lys48 (K48)-linked ubiquitination and degradation of DDX41 and negatively regulates the innate immune response to intracellular dsDNA.</span>

Here we identified the heliase DDX41 as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that sensed both c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP. DDX41 specifically and directly interacted with c-di-GMP. Knockdown of DDX41 via short hairpin RNA in mouse or human cells inhibited the induction of genes encoding molecules involved in the innate immune response and resulted in defective activation of STING, TBK1 and IRF3 in response to c-di-GMP or c-di-AMP. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP are detected by DDX41, which forms a complex with STING to signal to TBK1-IRF3 and activate the interferon response.</span>

Three murine cell lines (RAW264.7 macrophages as a positive control, FL83B hepatocytes, and MS1 endothelial cells) were assessed following exposure to adenovirus, DNA, or RNA ligands. Based on primary (interferon response factor 3 [IRF3] phosphorylation) and secondary (STAT1/2 phosphorylation) response markers, we found each cell line presented a unique response profile: RAW cells were highly responsive, MS1 cells were modified in their response, and FL83B cells were essentially nonresponsive. Comparative reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of nucleic acid sensing components revealed major differences between the three cell types. A prominent difference was at the level of adaptor molecules; TRIF, MyD88, MAVS, and STING. TRIF was absent in MS1 and FL83B cells, whereas MyD88 levels were diminished in FL83B hepatocytes. These differences resulted in compromised TLR-mediated activation. While the cytosolic adaptor MAVS was well represented in all cell lines, the DNA adaptor STING was deficient in FL83B hepatocytes (down by nearly 3 log units). The absence of STING provides an explanation for the lack of DNA responsiveness in these cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by acquisition of IRF3 activation in Flag-STING FL83B cells following DNA transfection. To consolidate the central role of adaptors in MS1 endothelial cells, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of STING and MAVS resulted in a ligand-specific loss of IRF3 responsiveness. In contrast to the requirement for specific adaptor proteins, a requirement for a specific DNA sensor (AIM2, DDx41, or p204) in the IRF3 activation response was not detected by shRNA knockdown in MS1 cells. The data reveal that cell-specific regulation of nucleic acid sensing cascade components influences antiviral recognition responses, that controlling levels of adaptor molecules is a recurring strategy in regulating antiviral recognition response functions, and that comparative RT-qPCR has predictive value for antiviral/innate response functions in these cells.</span>

Previous findings delineated that human neutrophils are unable to induce the transcription of IFN-β in response to TLR4 stimulation. Because neutrophils do not express protein kinase C ε, a molecule recently reported as essential for initiating the MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway, we optimized an electroporation method to transfect PKCε into neutrophils with very high efficiency. By doing so, a significant IFN-β mRNA expression was induced, in the absence of LPS stimulation, not only in PKCε-overexpressing neutrophils but also in cells transfected with a series of empty DNA plasmids; however, LPS further upregulated the IFN-β transcript levels in plasmid-transfected neutrophils, regardless of PKCε overexpression. Phosphoimmunoblotting studies, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation assays targeting the IFN-β promoter, revealed that IFN-β mRNA induction occurred through the cooperative action of IRF3, activated by transfected DNA, and NF-κB, activated by LPS. Additional immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that neutrophils constitutively express various cytosolic DNA sensors, including IFN-inducible protein 16, leucine-rich repeat (in Flightless I) interacting protein-1, and DDX41, as well as that IFN-inducible protein 16 is the intracellular receptor recognizing transfected DNA. Consistently, infection of neutrophils with intracellular pathogens, such as Bartonella henselae, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, or adenovirus type 5, promoted a marked induction of IFN-β mRNA expression. Taken together, these data raise questions about the role of PKCε in driving the MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent response and indicate that human neutrophils are able to recognize and respond to microbial cytosolic DNA.</span>

Infection of RAW 264.7 cells triggers an early response (2 to 6 h postinfection) that includes phosphorylation of the interferon (IFN) response factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factor, upregulation of IRF3 primary response genes (interferon-stimulated gene 56 [ISG56], beta IFN [IFN-β]), and subsequent type I IFN secondary signaling (STAT1/2 phosphorylation). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vectors, we show an essential role for Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in this pathway. Data also support a role for STING (MITA) as an adaptor functioning in response to rAdV infection. Using UV/psoralen (Ps)-inactivated virus to block viral transcription, Ps-inactivated virus stimulated primary (IRF3) and secondary (STAT1/2) activation events to the same degree as untreated virus. IRF3 phosphorylation was not blocked in RAW 264.7 cells pretreated with the RNA polymerase III inhibitor ML60218. However, they were compromised in the type I IFN-dependent secondary response (phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2). At 24 h postinfection, ML60218-treated cells were compromised in the overall antiviral response. Therefore, initial sensing of rAdV or viral DNA (vDNA) does not depend on viral template transcription, but ML60218 treatment influences cellular cascades required for an antiviral response to rAdV. Using overexpression or knockdown assays, we examined how four DNA sensors influence the antiviral response. Knockdown of DNA Activator of Interferon (DAI) and p204, the murine ortholog to IFI16, had minimal influence on IRF3 phosphorylation. However, knockdown of absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the helicase DDX41 resulted in diminished levels of (pser388)IRF3 following rAdV infection. Based on these data, multiple DNA sensors contribute to an antiviral DNA recognition response, leading to TBK1-dependent IRF3 phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells.</span>

To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.</span>

A new study suggests that the DExDc helicase DDX41 may function in dendritic cells as a DNA sensor to activate STING-dependent innate immune responses.</span>

Here we report the identification of DDX41, a member of the DEXDc family of helicases, as an intracellular DNA sensor in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). Knockdown of DDX41 expression by short hairpin RNA blocked the ability of mDCs to mount type I interferon and cytokine responses to DNA and DNA viruses. Overexpression of both DDX41 and the membrane-associated adaptor STING together had a synergistic effect in promoting Ifnb promoter activity. DDX41 bound both DNA and STING and localized together with STING in the cytosol. Knockdown of DDX41 expression blocked activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase TBK1 and the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3 by B-form DNA. Our results suggest that DDX41 is an additional DNA sensor that depends on STING to sense pathogenic DNA.</span>

Members of this family of proteins are linked to human disease, including cancer and viral infections. DEAD-box proteins contain two conserved domains that both contribute to RNA and ATP binding. Despite recent advances the molecular details of how these enzymes convert chemical energy into RNA remodeling is unknown. We present crystal structures of the isolated DEAD-domains of human DDX2A/eIF4A1, DDX2B/eIF4A2, DDX5, DDX10/DBP4, DDX18/myc-regulated DEAD-box protein, DDX20, DDX47, DDX52/ROK1, and DDX53/CAGE, and of the helicase domains of DDX25 and DDX41. Together with prior knowledge this enables a family-wide comparative structural analysis. We propose a general mechanism for opening of the RNA binding site. This analysis also provides insights into the diversity of DExD/H- proteins, with implications for understanding the functions of individual family members.</span>

RNA helicases participate in all biological processes that involve RNA, including transcription, splicing and translation. Based on the sequence of the helicase domain, they are classified into families, such as DDX and DHX families of human RNA helicases. The specificity of RNA helicases to their targets is likely due to several factors, such as the sequence, interacting molecules, subcellular localization and the expression pattern of the helicases. There are several examples of the involvement of RNA helicases in differentiation. Human DDX3 has two closely related genes designated DDX3Y and DDX3X, which are localized to the Y and X chromosomes, respectively. DDX3Y protein is specifically expressed in germ cells and is essential for spermatogenesis. DDX25 is another RNA helicase which has been shown to be required for spermatogenesis. DDX4 shows specific expression in germ cells. The Drosophila ortholog of DDX4, known as vasa, is required for the formation of germ cells and oogenesis by a mechanism that involves regulating the translation of mRNAs essential for differentiation. Abstrakt is the Drosphila ortholog of DDX41, which has been shown to be involved in visual and CNS system development. DDX5 (p68) and its related DDX17 (p72) have also been implicated in organ/tissue differentiation. The ability of RNA helicases to modulate the structure and thus availability of critical RNA molecules for processing leading to protein expression is the likely mechanism by which RNA helicases contribute to differentiation.</span>

Although over-expression of DJ-1 has been reported in several cancer cells, including cells in breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer, the precise mechanism underlying transformation has not been clarified. In this study, we screened proteins by a yeast two-hybrid method and identified Abstrakt as a DJ-1-binding protein. Abstrakt is an RNA helicase, but it has not yet been characterized. Northern blot analysis showed that human Abstrakt was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. Abstrakt was then found to bind to and to be colocalized in the nucleus with DJ-1 in human cells. Furthermore, Abstrakt was found to stimulate transforming activity of DJ-1 in rat 3Y1 cells transfected with DJ-1 with activated ras. These findings suggest that Abstrakt is a positive regulator for DJ-1.</span>

Sorting Nexin-2 (SNX2) is involved in protein sorting in the trans-Golgi network, endosome, and/or lysosome compartments, with loss of function leading to defect in protein sorting and stress on organelles. To investigate the function of SNX2, we have identified the DEAD-box helicase Abstrakt (Abs) as an SNX2-interacting protein. The N-terminal domain of Abs interacts with the phox homology (PX) domain of SNX2 suggesting that PX domains may also participate in protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, both proteins undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and this process is responsive to serum withdrawal for Abs. Finally, expression of Abs reduced the cellular expression of SNX2 without altering its steady state mRNA levels. This unexpected interaction provides a novel mechanism whereby expression of proteins involved in membrane trafficking could be regulated by an RNA helicase.</span>
