<!-- # Analysis example of publicly available SCT data {#actual}



Here, we show analytic example of actual SCT data using `scstruc`. We will demonstrate how to infer GRN and evaluate them using the library. First, we need to load the data into `SingleCellExperiment` (SCE) object. This part is time consuming and we read RDS file storing the list of SCE objects from each sample. -->
